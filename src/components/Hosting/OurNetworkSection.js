                        When you host your project with the OpenInfra Foundation, youâ€™re tapping into a vast network of
                        open
                        infrastructure operators. This broad ecosystem have a vested interest in not only supporting the
                        set of open
                        source projects they currently rely on to power their businesses, but are looking for the next
                        solution to
                        take their efforts to the next level. OpenInfra projects have an inside track to proof of
                        concept (POC) and
                        production use at some of the most impactful companies in the world.
