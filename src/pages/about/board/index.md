    description: >-
      I started my working career in technology close to twenty years ago. It
      has surely not  been an average career, but a career where I've
      continually learned and evolved to fulfill the need. In  a sense, it all
      started with Linux and answering some questions about installing Linux.
      This started a  journey into computer networking and eventually shifted to
      a systems engineering focus with a stop-over  in data center
      operations.</p> 

      <p>The DevOps movement lead me more into software development and the operationalization of software due  to the need to automate large scale systems deployments. This required bringing an operational perspective  while bridging to the requirements, and often required digging deep into the underlying code to solve the  problem of the day.</p> 

      <p>In a sense, I found a home in OpenStack in 2014 and the Ironic project in 2015 because of many years  spent working with physical hardware in data centers.</p> <p>I presently work for Red Hat as a Principal Software Engineer, where my upstream focus has been Ironic  for the past few years, and my downstream focus has been on helping lead adoption and use of Ironic.
