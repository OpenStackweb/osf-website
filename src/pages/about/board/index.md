      <p>I started my working career in technology close to twenty years ago. It
      has surely not  been an average career, but a career where I've
      continually learned and evolved to fulfill the need. In  a sense, it all
      started with Linux and answering some questions about installing Linux.
      This started a  journey into computer networking and eventually shifted to
      a systems engineering focus with a stop-over  in data center
      operations.</p>

      <p>The DevOps movement lead me more into software development and the operationalization of software due  to the need to automate large scale systems deployments. This required bringing an operational perspective  while bridging to the requirements, and often required digging deep into the underlying code to solve the  problem of the day.</p> 

      <p>In a sense, I found a home in OpenStack in 2014 and the Ironic project in 2015 because of many years  spent working with physical hardware in data centers.</p> <p>I presently work for Red Hat as a Principal Software Engineer, where my upstream focus has been Ironic  for the past few years, and my downstream focus has been on helping lead adoption and use of Ironic.</p>

      With Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS), we have a publicly funded project to
      build cloud standards, software and operational knowledge. The reference
      implementation is openly developed open source and contains Linux,
      kvm,ceph, ovn, OpenStack, Kubernetes, K8s-CAPI along with operational and
      IAM tooling. The project is carried out in the OSBA and the
      standardization will continue there in 2025.

      Dec 2018 - Dec 2019, I was responsible for the Cloud and Storage Departments in SUSE R&D. SUSE was a strong OpenStack supporter but then changed direction in ways that I could not support.

      Before SUSE, I was leading the architecture, community and consulting teams in Deutsche Telekom's Open Telekom Cloud Team.

      DT has been a vocal supporter of OpenStack since I joined in early 2012 -- we have been able to run several OpenStack projects. I personally supported the InterOp Workig Group, when DT became gold member of the OpenStack Foundation in 2016. I was serving in the board in as DT rep as well as individual member after moving on from DT.

      Before joining DT at the end of 2011 I was a long-time contributor to the Linux kernel, which also gave me the privilege of building up and leading SUSE Labs and work with a number of great engineers in- and outside my company, contributing to the success of the Open Source technology.
