    description: >-
      <p>I started my working career in technology close to twenty years ago. It
      has surely not  been an average career, but a career where I've
      continually learned and evolved to fulfill the need. In  a sense, it all
      started with Linux and answering some questions about installing Linux.
      This started a  journey into computer networking and eventually shifted to
      a systems engineering focus with a stop-over  in data center
      operations.</p>

      <p>The DevOps movement lead me more into software development and the operationalization of software due  to the need to automate large scale systems deployments. This required bringing an operational perspective  while bridging to the requirements, and often required digging deep into the underlying code to solve the  problem of the day.</p> 

      <p>In a sense, I found a home in OpenStack in 2014 and the Ironic project in 2015 because of many years  spent working with physical hardware in data centers.</p> <p>I presently work for Red Hat as a Principal Software Engineer, where my upstream focus has been Ironic  for the past few years, and my downstream focus has been on helping lead adoption and use of Ironic.</p>

      I started my careen in 1997 at IBM Germany, when I came across a new open-source operating system called Linux which drew a lot of my attention and continued to do so until present time. Over the time the scope grew larger, and I followed the open-source path to the cloud world and got part of the OpenStack (back then) and now OpenInfra family. 

      Since 2012 I'm with T-Systems in different leadership roles and in 2014 we started a project to launch a public cloud for T-Systems/ Deutsche Telekom. This was the start of Open Telekom Cloud (OTC)! 

      As the infrastructure lead and chief engineer, I am responsible for everything between the upper edge of double floor in the data center and the upper edge of the operating system. Open Telekom Cloud is by now one of the largest OpenStack-based clouds in Europe, providing full GDPR-compliance and the full stack of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS offerings.

      Apart from doing all that computer stuff, I am married, have a son, and enjoy a lot doing some cooking & baking, spending time with my family and travelling throughout the world.
