**Is there a sample Participation Agreement for my organization’s legal team to review?**

Yes. You can see a sample of that agreement [here](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/openinfra-foundation.pdf).\
\
**Will I be required to create a Linux Foundation ID, even though I already have an OpenInfra ID?**\
\
Yes. As part of signing the Participation Agreement, you will be asked to create an LFID. You can tie an existing Github or Google account to the LFID, or create a brand new account with the Linux Foundation. There is no charge to create this, but it is required.

**My organization is not a Linux Foundation member yet. How do I sign up?** 

You can sign up for a Linux Foundation membership [through the same link](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=openinfra-foundation) as signing your OpenInfra Participation Agreement. You can see a sample of the Linux Foundation Membership Agreement [here](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/tlf.pdf).

**The signup steps are asking me to sign a Training & Events MSA. What is this?**

If your organization is not yet a member of the Linux Foundation, you will have to complete this as part of your contract. There is no charge to sign the Training & Events MSA, but it is required for membership in the Linux Foundation. You can see a sample of the agreement [here](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/General-Event-Sponsorshi-&-Training-and-Certification-Terms.pdf).

**When should I expect my OpenInfra participation agreement to be countersigned?** 

Once the OpenInfra Foundation Directed Fund is established, the Linux Foundation will proceed with countersigning the Participation Agreements. 

**I see Legacy pricing on the Participation Agreement, how do I know if my organization qualifies for that tier?**\
\
The “legacy startup fee” level of Gold and Silver Membership is only available to Qualified OIF Members who prior to the Closing Date had executed a Startup Agreement with OpenStack Foundation and such Startup Agreement was still in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.
