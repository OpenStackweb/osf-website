      Jonathan Bryce, who has spent his career building the cloud, is Executive
      Director of the Open Infrastructure Foundation. Previously he was a founder of The
      Rackspace Cloud. He started his career working as a web developer for
      Rackspace, and during his tenure, he and  co-worker Todd Morey had a
      vision to build a sophisticated web hosting environment where users and 
      businesses alike could turn to design, develop and deploy their ideal web
      site – all without being  responsible for procuring the technology,
      installing it or making sure it is built to be always  available. This
      vision became The Rackspace Cloud. Since then he has been a major driver
      of  OpenStack, the open source cloud software initiative.</p>

      Mark has been lucky enough to participate in many disruptive technology
      shifts, from the introduction  of the first GPUs at Dell in the 90s as a
      product manager, to the digital music/MP3 transition at  Musicmatch as
      Director of Business Development. After Yahoo! acquired Musicmatch,
      combining the #1  streaming radio service with the #1 digital music app,
      Mark served as Sr Director, establishing  strategic partnerships for one
      of the first on demand streaming music services. In 2009, Mark joined 
      Rackspace, an early pioneer in cloud computing, as VP of Business
      Development, focused on building  their cloud ecosystem. <p>In 2010, to
      accelerate the cloud ecosystem's development, Mark co-founded a new open
      source cloud  computing project called OpenStack, in partnership with NASA
      and 25 other organizations globally.  OpenStack quickly became one of the
      fastest growing open source projects in history. In 2012, Mark  co-founded
      the Open Infrastructure Foundation to manage the growth of the project, where he now
      serves at  the COO. Today, OpenStack is one of the 3 most actively
      developed open source projects in the world,  along with the Linux kernel
      and Chromium.</p> <p>Mark is now helping to expand and evolve the
      Foundation’s mission, bringing the unique open  collaboration method
      established by the OpenStack community to many new open source projects
      across  the cloud infrastructure market, including Kata Containers, the
      Zuul CI/CD platform, the StarlingX  edge computing platform, and Airship.
