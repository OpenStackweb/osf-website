#### **Note from the Chair of the OpenInfra Foundation Board of Directors**

***Allison Randal, Board Chair*** 

While 2021 was a year of continued uncertainty around a pandemic that still hasn't quite managed to end, for many it was also a year of contemplation. The trend has many different names, including the "Great Resignation," but the name that seems most apt to me is the "Great Reprioritization." One silver lining in the pandemic cloud has been a chance to put the daily grind on hold, opening up a bit of headspace for strategic thinking, for reflecting on who we are, where we want to go, and how we'll get there. This is not only true for individuals, but also for organizations and projects.

After launching as the [Open Infrastructure (OpenInfra) Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) in 2020, last year has been about fully embracing our new identity, combining healthy doses of both welcoming the new and cleaning out a few dusty corners of the old. We spent time thinking about the support our projects need, and how we can get better at delivering the "long-term care & feeding" that sustains projects and helps them to grow and succeed, including how we fund project-specific needs. We spent time thinking about how to recognize the diverse contributions of a broader array of organizations in our community, and added two new classes of membership to help with that: Associate Members (non-profit and educational organizations) and Silver Members. We're all looking forward to gathering in person again as soon as it's safe, but in 2021 we got better at virtual communication, engaging within our community and reaching out to other communities, through regular thought-provoking topics on [OpenInfra Live](https://openinfra.live) and [OpenInfra Live Keynotes](https://openinfra.dev/live/keynotes), project coordination and planning at the [Project Teams Gatherings](https://openinfra.dev/ptg) (PTGs), and informal strategic discussions.

Successful open source isn't automatic or trivial; it requires strategic focus, a dedication to best practices in community governance, open collaboration, and technical excellence, and active engagement from all involved. Like most worthwhile endeavors, successful open source takes persistence and hard work. It is awe-inspiring to look back on what we've accomplished in open infrastructure over the past decade, through shared effort for shared benefit, and I can't wait to see what we'll do in the next decade.

It has been an honor to serve the OpenInfra community as Board Chair in 2021. My personal thanks go out to every person in our staff, board, project leaders, and participants, for all you contribute to open infrastructure and open source.

#### Replicating Success by Applying the Power of the OpenInfra Community

***Jonathan Bryce, Executive Director, OpenInfra Foundation***

I recently saw these two headlines nearly adjacent to each other on an open source news feed: 

*Does open source software have a future?*

*Open source is more important than ever.*

I found this both amusing and gratifying, because the second headline is the clear and resounding answer to the first. My admittedly biased opinion has been validated by the findings of numerous surveys and analyst reports this year, for example:

* The 2022 State of Open Source Report, issued by OpenLogic by Perforce and the Open Source Initiative in February, reported that 77% of respondents increased the use of open source software in their organizations over the last 12 months, and 36.5% indicated that they increased the use significantly.
* Also in February “The State of Enterprise Open Source: A Red Hat Report ” documented that 95% of respondents to its survey said that enterprise open source is important to their organization's overall enterprise infrastructure and that 82% of IT leaders are more likely to select a vendor who contributes to the open source community.
* In March, a survey conducted by Ashnik indicated “about 82% of organizations today rely on open source to 'drive innovation' within the organization; 100% voted 'ease of adoption' as the best feature of open-source. Over 95% of respondents cited that open source offers 'higher security' over proprietary software.”
* In September, the TODO Group issued findings from its Open Source Program Management Survey, which revealed that the adoption of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) or similar programs has risen to 50% of respondents, the highest level in five years. 
* And our very own OpenStack User Survey, published in November, documented more than 40 million cores of OpenStack compute in production, which is a 60% increase compared to 2021 and a 166% increase since 2020. 
* Al Gillen, group VP, Software Development and Open Source at IDC, acknowledges in the firm’s “Market Analysis Perspective, Worldwide Open source Ecosystem, 2022” report issued in November, "As the industry transitions out of the pandemic years, the use of open source software continues unabated (emphasis added)…”, despite security concerns regarding open source software supply chains. 

Open source is, indeed, more important than ever.

And I would take that one step further: Open infrastructure is more important than ever. 

Mark Collier, our COO, painted an exciting picture during his [Summit keynote address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlPLGmBfaVc) (delivered live, in-person, in Berlin!) of how rapidly IT is advancing and therefore how critical it is for us all to work together to build the infrastructure our world needs. 

Meeting that need is why 60 organizations joined together two years ago to support the relaunch of the OpenStack Foundation as a new Open Infrastructure Foundation with a broader mission and scope of building open source communities who write infrastructure software that runs in production. Since then, membership of sponsoring organizations at all levels has grown by more than 33%, and Silver Members now exceed 50. Ant Group, Bloomberg, FiberHome, Meta, Microsoft, Nipa Cloud, Vexxhost and Wind River have joined as OpenInfra Platinum or Gold Members within the last 18 months. The expanded mission has also enabled the OpenInfra Foundation to tap into new regions, garnering increased support from organizations in Africa and Southeast Asia. 

These organizations recognize the value of the OpenInfra model and know the global OpenInfra community excels in delivering open source infrastructure software that runs in production, as evidenced by the success of projects such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [Kata Containers](http://katacontainers.io), [StarlingX](http://starlingx.io) and [Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/). 

Earlier this year, we announced a way for these sponsoring organizations to invest directly in the projects they care most about. The OpenInfra Foundation’s [Directed Funding](https://openinfra.dev/projects/hosting/) approach offers project communities the opportunity to tap into:

* A global network of 110,000 individuals, 182 countries and 700+ organizations;
* A customizable approach to building successful, sustainable open infrastructure projects, based on [The Four Opens](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/) and with services delivered by the OpenInfra Foundation staff;
* A legal, project-specific funding entity with a project fund governing board, comprising at least one OpenInfra Foundation Platinum Member sponsor joined by multiple funding partners. This entity is created in an efficient way, but is flexible enough to be modified based on the needs of the project community.

The Directed Funds approach is all about replicating success by applying the power of the OpenInfra Community—one of the most productive groups of collaborative individuals and organizations on the planet. Thank you for all you do. You are amazing.

Did you know that if you count our years together as the OpenStack Foundation, the OpenInfra Foundation celebrated its 10th anniversary this year? Ten years in, I’m happy to say that our mission is more relevant than ever, our community is more committed than ever, and the future for open infrastructure is brighter than ever. Working together, the decade to come will be our most impactful yet.

#### **State of OpenInfra: Introducing Project Funds**

***Thierry Carrez, General Manager, OpenInfra Foundation***

So the world needs more open source solutions for providing infrastructure. More OpenInfra. We need to make those solutions featureful yet easy to operate, while ensuring they work well together. How do we rise to this challenge? How do we bring that vision to life?

In a word: *together.*

Our long-held belief is that successful and long-lasting open source projects require developing and balancing three forces: developers, users, and ecosystem.

Developers and other direct contributors to the open source projects produce the software that makes it all happen. They are the core of the community, and without them, nothing gets done. As a Foundation, we support them by running Project Teams Gathering events to allow them to meet in a productive setting, and by providing resources to support key functions like community management, project infrastructure, contributor onboarding, release management or vulnerability management.

But good code is not enough. Good code is worth nothing if it’s not used in production to solve real problems. We need users, and we need them engaged in our community, sharing their experiences and providing feedback to the developers. As a Foundation, we support users by running specific Forum sessions at our OpenInfra Summits, as well as leading initiatives like the OpenStack Large Scale SIG where our largest users come together to share their experience running some of the largest infrastructure deployments in the world. We also support and engage in community and industry events around the world, spreading the word about open infrastructure and our projects.

In order to have successful and sustainable developer and user forces, we need a third one: the ecosystem force. A thriving ecosystem ensures that contributors can get employed, and that users can find products, solutions and support to help them. As a Foundation, we support the ecosystem by building strong brands around our projects, defending the trademarks, and encouraging interoperability. We help give ecosystem products and solutions the exposure they need in a very crowded space, through the marketplace at our Summits and on our project websites, our social media properties and our publications.\
<br />
<br />

![3 Forces ](/img/image-1-.png)

<br />
<br />

Together, developers, users and ecosystem forces ensure the success and the long-term sustainability of our projects. This is the model we want to follow to enable more OpenInfra in the future. Our new Project Fund offering enables our OpenInfra ecosystem to coalesce around funding specific new initiatives, in a targeted, transparent, and cost-efficient manner. Tackling the next decade of Open Infrastructure, together.

So this is a call to action. The world is encountering crazy challenges today, and at the same time it seems to retract behind boundaries and want to collaborate less. But rising to those crazy challenges requires sharing more, requires wasting less energy reinventing separate wheels. And infrastructure is a great area to all openly collaborate on. So let’s collaborate and build more open source solutions for providing infrastructure, without boundaries. Let’s do more OpenInfra. Together.

#### **State of OpenInfra China**

In 2022, the OpenInfra community in China has grown immensely. With numerous volunteers and a large base of Open Infrastructure organizations, China has remained the second largest OpenStack community in the world. 

**OpenStack TC: Venus and Skyline Release**

There were two new projects submitted, accepted and released by OpenStack TC:

* Venus project - provides a one-stop solution to log management services.
* Skyline project - a modern OpenStack dashboard optimized by UI and UE. 

The Venus project was initiated by Inspur Data, and contributed to the community. With development moving forward, more than three organizations, including StackHPC, China Telecom and Zhengzhou Yunhai Info Tech have started contributing to the upstream project. This has helped release the features like full text/multi-dimensional retrieval, typical error analysis, call chain analysis and many more.

The Skyline project was originally initiated and contributed by 99Cloud. Now there are more than four organizations participating in the upstream development and because of that, it was included in the OpenStack 26th release. 

**Cyborg**

In the past year, Cyborg continues to feature its development as well as a more diverse upstream community. In the last release, more than 25 organizations around the world participated in Cyborg upstream development, including a list of companies from China.

**Kata Containers Growth in China**

Kata Containers has made significant progress in 2022, especially in the China community. 

Two new user case studies were released by China Unicorn and Inspur Data, which targeted mass deployument of Kata Containers. Ant Group’s Kata Container usage white paper was also released in 2022, gaining a lot of visibility globally and even won a Superuser Award. Over 300 developers are actively communicating with each other in the wechat group and discussing technical issues and sharing their deployment.

**Computing Force Network (CFN) Working Group**

In 2022, a new CFN working group was founded, initially driven by China Mobile. The group is aiming to formulate solutions for common challenges using related technologies, promoting technical implementations and gradually building the next generation of open infrastructure. The working group has been widely recognized and had a total of 16 organizations join the taskforce in 2022. Currently the working group has its own subteams set up with weekly community meetings hosted on wechat.

Regarding community communication, most of the news press, software updates, event sharing and user case studies were posted through wechat public accounts. In the past year, major 3 foundation and projects wechat accounts had 118 posts in total, and subscribers in total exceeded 11k, with an average 28.7% increase rate year over year.

**OpenInfra Day China** 

Although the pandemic prevented in-person events from being organized, the China community was still able to successfully deliver a virtual OpenInfra Days China, with over 20,000 attendees tuning in online. This was the first year that we collaborated with major Chinese open source communities such as InfoQ, CSDN and Open Source China. A big thank you to our lovely China volunteer team for helping organize the event.

#### **Introducing: OpenInfra Foundation Associate Members**

***Thierry Carrez, General Manager, OpenInfra Foundation*** 

The Associate membership program was created with two objectives: getting academic and research institutions (traditionally large users of open infrastructure) more directly involved in our communities, and creating a framework for close collaboration with partner non-profit organizations that promote the use of open source software to provide infrastructure.

Over the course of 2022 we grew this program from 11 members to 21 members. On the academic and research front, Indiana University (home for the NSF “Jetstream 2” initiative), the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, North Dakota State University, INRIA, Telecom Paris and Delhi University have joined us. On the non-profit side, the Open Source Initiative (the body that safeguards the Open Source Definition and maintains the list of approved Open Source licenses), the DMTF standards body, as well as the eMerging Open Tech Foundation became Associate members this year.

These memberships all reflect active collaborations between our Foundation and those institutions on sharing operational experience, marketing open infrastructure, defending open source, or teaching the next generation of OpenInfra talent.

If you are interested in joining this program, please reach out to ecosystem@openinfra.dev!

## **OpenInfra Project Updates**

</div>

Airship was announced as an OpenInfra Foundation pilot project at the 2018 OpenStack Summit in Vancouver with the mission to create a unified, fully-declarative, versatile platform that transforms bare-metal infrastructure into a resilient Kubernetes cluster supporting user-defined workloads. In practice, this meant that the project has been using YAML files and a declarative method to define the structure of the infrastructure services, such as Kubernetes and OpenStack components to be deployed on top of bare-metal servers.

By the start of 2022, the community had successfully created a platform to install a Kubernetes-based environment and deploy OpenStack services in containers on top of it. The project had 2 releases, where the second release provided some fundamental architectural changes and was starting to include support for deploying services on top of public clouds as well. Airship has been running in production at AT&T to power its Network Cloud infrastructure.

At the same time, the project created an opinionated way to deploy both Kubernetes and OpenStack that prevented it from building diversity in the user and contributor ecosystems alike. At the beginning of the year the community had contributors from companies such as AT&T, Microsoft and Mirantis. Throughout 2022, the project transitioned into a production maintenance phase, where the community's activities shifted over to maintaining the existing software rather than working towards a roadmap with new functionality. If you have questions or want to understand your open source options, contact info@airshipit.org.

The community also adopted a simplified governance model that is based on consensus-based decision-making, to allow the current and future contributors of the project to collaborate and shape the governance model easily and efficiently.

Since becoming a pilot project in December 2017, Kata Containers has rapidly become a highly sought-after and unique container runtime favored by Enterprises. In April of 2019, Kata Containers was the first Open Infrastructure Foundation pilot project to graduate, becoming an official open infrastructure project. In 2022, Kata Containers continued to expand its use cases and gained more users.

The Kata Containers project began as a combination of Intel Clear Containers & Hyper Runv, with the objective of providing stronger isolation than traditional containers with minimal latency. Over the years many improvements have been made to Kata Containers code in pursuit of maintaining and improving security, performance and speed. One of the most exciting improvements is the move from Golang to Rust, which began in 2022 in Kata Containers 2.0 by way of transition to Rust Agent. The “Rustification” of Kata Containers progressed steadily throughout minor 2.x releases, & in October 2022 a Rust-based runtime-rs & Rust-based virtio-rs storage driver was introduced with the release of Kata Containers 3.0.0. Hypervisor support was updated as well, with support for Cloud-Hypervisor & QEMU updated to the latest respective releases along with new Dragonball hypervisor support added. 

Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Kata Containers community expanded Kata Containers’ usage scenario covering security isolation and performance isolation. This prevents different workloads from affecting each other in both security and performance aspects. Kata Containers has also maintained the support of the Confidential Containers use case with TDX/SEV/IBM SE enabled isolation, further expanding Kata Containers’ threat model by protecting the infrastructure and its workloads.

In 2022, the Kata Containers community continues to present its strategic relevance, well-defined governance procedures, commitment to technical best practices and open collaboration. Most importantly, they remain an actively engaged ecosystem of developers and users working together to create and maintain a truly unique alternative that integrates seamlessly with multiple architectures & hypervisors. In the spirit of open collaboration, community volunteers participated in a university mentorship program with Boston University, working closely with a group of undergraduate and graduate students to further implement Rust code into the Kata Containers project.

Kata Containers celebrated a significant increase in popularity in 2022, after Microsoft announced at KubeCon North America, that Kata Containers support has been added to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). When Kata Containers is deployed on top of an Azure-tuned Mariner Kernel and Cloud-Hypervisor it brings hardware-enforced isolation with a dedicated kernel per pod. This helps achieve higher security for workloads especially when they share a single [AKS cluster.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-kubernetes-service-kubecon-na-2022-announcements/ba-p/3660682)

Additionally, Red Hat released the Kata Containers-based Red Hat OpenShift sandboxed containers in October of 2022. OpenShift Sandbox Containers provide an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant container runtime using lightweight virtual machines (VMs) running your workloads in their own isolated kernel, contributing an additional layer of isolation to Red Hat’s [defense-in-depth strategy.](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/openshift-sandboxed-containers)

The community-selected Architecture Committee went through two election cycles in February and November of 2021. Current AC chairs are Fabiano Fidêncio (Intel), Eric Ernst (Apple), Peng Tao (Ant Group), Samuel Ortiz (RivOS) and newly-elected Gerry Liu (Alibaba Cloud). The Architecture Committee members ensure that Kata Containers continues to be aligned with its goal of open collaboration and innovation around container speed and security. To better accommodate rapid community growth, the Architecture Committee will be expanded from five to seven seats for 2023.

In 2023, Kata Containers will continue to evolve as a fast and secure runtime through further Rust implementation and integrated Dragonball Sandbox technology, further reducing memory footprint along with installation & management complexity. In addition to further improvement of Kata Containers as a multi-hypervisor, multi-tenant container runtime that integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, the Kata community will continue to be an outstanding example of open source community through mentorship & education.

The Kata Containers’ project code is hosted on GitHub under the Apache 2 license. To learn more about Kata Containers, and how to contribute and support the community, you can go to katacontainers.io or check out these channels to get involved:

Building on the [Mass Open Cloud](http://massopen.cloud) (MOC), a real-world platform delivering open source projects as services, OI Labs is an incubator for new approaches to the all-open source cloud focused on bridging the gap between operators and developers and delivering open source tools to build and run cloud, container, AI, big data and edge workloads efficiently, repeatedly and predictably.

In 2022 the Mass Open Cloud became the Mass Open Cloud Alliance.

The efforts associated with OI Labs frequently overlap multiple open source projects - for example: 

* Cloud in a Box: Prescriptive Cloud Installations which encompass monitoring, onboarding, offboarding, and billing/reporting.  The initial implementations of this include:
* The [New England Research Cloud](https://nerc.mghpcc.org/) (NERC) project by Boston University and Harvard University, integrating [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and OpenShift with standard Research Computing productions systems such as the [ColdFront](https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/) resource allocation management systems as a basis for a standardized research computing software stack.
* The Op1st [Community Cloud](https://youtu.be/yJcT2z06kb0), a prototype of the [Operate First](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) Project incubated at OI Labs, is focused on incorporating operational experience into the development of software projects rather than as an afterthought.
* [Project Caerus](https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs/caerus/blob/master/Manifesto.pdf):  Project Caerus is an initiative focused on bridging the gap between distributed compute and distributed storage platforms commonly used for big data and AI applications. Caerus aims to create a new open ecosystem that allows compute and storage platforms from different sources to operate in a concerted fashion to substantially improve application performance, resource utilization and application developer productivity.
* [Elastic Secure Infrastructure (ESI)](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/esi): A set of services/systems to permit multiple tenants to flexibly allocate baremetal machines from a pool of available hardware, create networks, attach baremetal nodes and networks, and optionally provision an operating system on those systems through the use of an associated provisioning service.  The code development features a mix of upstream OpenStack work (ironic and networking-ansible) and custom ESI code.  
* [Project Wenju](https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs/wenju): Addressing the “last mile” challenges of moving AI projects into production.
* [Project Taibai](https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs/taibai-microserviceplatform): Taibai takes advantage of a microservices framework to deliver a scalable and customizable multi-cloud platform that enterprises can use to simplify multi-cloud management and improve the efficiency of cloud resource utilization. The Taibai unified service portal allows users, administrators and operators to manage diverse cloud architectures and third-party integration across multiple data centers and public clouds.  Your may view the introduction of the project at this link: [Project Taibai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdryIUcs4y4)
* [Operate First Community Cloud](https://www.operate-first.cloud/): The [Operate First Community Cloud](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) has grown substantially to approx 250 members and 50 projects, such as [OKD](https://www.okd.io/blog/2022-10-25-OKD-Streams-Building-the-Next-Generation-of-OKD-together/), OS-Climate, [Apicurio](https://www.apicur.io/), and acts as an experimentation environment for Red Hat Emerging Technologies and beyond. The architecture is the blueprint for NERC.
* * Infrastructure 198 namespaces (77 user namespaces), 5 clusters, 71 nodes, 1582 cores
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/operate-first) community diversity: 37% Red Hat, 63% others/unknown
  * Active media channels on [YouTube](https://op1.st/youtube), [Twitter](https://op1.st/twitter) and since November also [Mastodon](https://op1.st/mastodon)
  * [Bi-weekly community meet up](https://www.operate-first.cloud/meetup/) started season two in Oct. 2022
  * 15+ [services](https://service-catalog.operate-first.cloud/) running e.g. Backstage and OpenDataHub

OpenStack continues to be one of the most active open source communities with more than 25 million cores in production. This year, the OpenStack community continued to produce more software that is run in production. Notable highlights include: 

* [Wallaby](https://www.openstack.org/software/wallaby/): Wallaby, the 23rd release of OpenStack, was developed by over 800 contributors from 140 organizations in 45 countries. Comprised of more than 17,000 code changes, Wallaby focused on integration with other open source projects like CEPH, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. OpenStack continues to be the third most active open source project (along with the Linux kernel and Chromium). 
* [Xena](https://www.openstack.org/software/xena/): The Xena release brought with it better integration amongst OpenStack projects, support for advanced hardware features, and reduction of technical debt. Nova's support for SmartNICs and ECMP routes in Neutron are a few of the hardware features now supported. Together, over 680 contributors worked in a short 25 weeks to present the 24th release of OpenStack. 
* [Technical Writing SIG Dissolution](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/815869): After successfully migrating the docs to project repositories several releases ago, and mostly maintaining an advisory role now, the Technical Writing SIG decided to dissolve and migrate the last of their repositories to other teams. At the PTG, the Technical Writing SIG Chair met with the Technical Committee and the First Contact SIG worked out a plan to retire the Technical Writing SIG.
* [Skyline](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/814037): OpenStack welcomed its newest project since the addition of Adjutant in 2018! Skyline is an OpenStack dashboard built with React as an alternative to the Horizon dashboard. While not ready for production use just yet, the dashboard is engineered so that functions directly call OpenStack APIs to make maintaining the dashboard easier for developers and interactions faster and more efficient for users. This effort has been supported by the Horizon team as a future replacement once Skyline's functionality gets closer to parity with Horizon. The Technical Committee accepted with with the caveat that Skyline with be labeled as a 'tech preview' until it undergoes the changes to bring it more in line with how other OpenStack services are organized and released.
* [TC Stance on OpenStackClient](https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/resolutions/20201028-openstackclient-tc-policy.rst): The Technical Committee formalized their stance on the OpenStackClient in a resolution this year. Instead of making the development of OpenStackClient a community wide goal, but still wanting to show support and stand with the OpenStackClient team, they settled on a resolution with the intention of circling back to evaluate if the OpenStack community is ready for the OpenStackClient community goal. 
* [IRC Network Migration](https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/resolutions/20210526-move-irc-to-oftc.rst): There was a change in ownership, organization structure, and policy in Freenode, the IRC network that the community has made use of for years. In response, the community discussed alternatives and settled on migrating over to a different network, but keeping IRC as the synchronous chat platform our community uses. As of late May, the OpenStack community has moved to the OFTC Network. Most teams were a part of this transition.

#### **[More OpenStack in Production than Ever](https://openstack.org/users)**

[](openstack.org/users)***Allison Price, Director of Marketing & Community, OpenInfra Foundation***

In November 2020, the OpenStack community celebrated 15 million cores in production. Just 12 months later, over 25 million cores were recorded in the annual OpenStack User Survey, marking 66% growth compared to 2020. This growth was seen among organizations of all sizes, including seven organizations who were recording over 1 million cores in production.

StarlingX is an open source community that is supported by the Open Infrastructure Foundation. The project integrates together well-known open source projects such as Ceph, Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, OpenStack, and more to create a a fully integrated cloud platform that is optimized for edge and IoT use cases.

The project was launched in 2018 and since then the community has put out 5 releases. StarlingX 5.0 was released in June 2021. This version of the platform included new features in areas such as security and hardware acceleration as well as some new functionality that was targeting factory automation.

Security related features included integrating Vault into the platform for secret management to provide the ability to store and access secrets securely. These secrets can include credentials, encryption keys, API tokens and other data that should not be stored in plain text on a system. This new component improves the platform’s security posture and encryption capabilities while maintaining manageability. Beyond this the community also made improvements to certification management to enhance automation in this area.

Hardware acceleration is becoming an enabler for various edge computing use cases and is in focus for StarlingX as well. The community added support for Nvidia GPUs, enabling operators to do additional offload for workloads that require GPU power, such as machine learning or other image-based processing applications.

Another key enhancement in this area was to add the ability to orchestrate FPGA image updates that provides the option to deploy FPGA with orchestrations that are automated from end to end.

In the 5.0 release the StarlingX community introduced a new feature called ‘edgeworker’ node, that is a new personality distinguished from 'worker' nodes. Edgeworker nodes are usually deployed close to an edge device, such as an I/O device, a camera, a servo motor or a sensor, to manage host-based enrollment to provide the possibility to manage industrial PCs and devices and sensors in these environments from StarlingX.

Beyond the above, the release also contained features and enhancements like:

* Improvements to certification management to enhance automation
* Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Notification Framework
* Containerized Ceph storage by using Rook
* Support for Net-SNMP v3 for the fault management service
* CephFS for cluster storage
* Container Image Signature Validation

During 2021 the community also started working on to enable using Debian as the base operating system for the plaform. Along with that change the build system is also getting improved. As these changes do not fit into one release cycle they will become available incrementally in later releases.

The community held two election cycles in 2021 to give opportunities for new leaders to arise. Both the Technical Steering Committee seats and Project and Technical Lead positions were up for re-election over the course of the year to extend and refresh the whole leadership of the project.

The community was participating in industry events to spread the word about the progress the contributors are making as well as to provide the opportunity for the contributors and new comers to come together and discuss project related matters, such as design, development and testing related topics. There were presentations about the project at virtual events such as the Open Infrastructure Summit, OpenInfra Live and Edge Computing World and contributors discussed technical details about the project at the two Project Teams Gathering (PTG) events.

The project had 3,150 changes committed by 148 authors from 5 organizations during the year.

2021 increased the commercial adoption of StarlingX. Besides T-Systems and Verizon, Vodafone is now deploying StarlingX as part of their infrastructure to utilize the platform's capabilities to power their ORAN rollout, which is the first official ORAN deployment in Europe.

  </a>
</div>

Zuul is an open source CI/CD platform designed for test-driven open source projects and software development organizations who need to gate against multiple projects and systems before landing a single patch. Since 2012, Zuul has been proven at scale as a critical part of the OpenStack development process. In 2018, Zuul version 3.0
was released with the intention of making Zuul easier to use outside of the OpenStack project. Since then we've seen the number of users and use cases grow tremendously. You will find Zuul behind cloud, e-commerce, and automotive software ensuring that every commit passes tests and is ready to be merged.

2021 was a big year for Zuul, in large part due to the efforts to remove all single points of failure from its component services. The goal is to allow you to run a highly available Zuul cluster that requires no downtime to perform maintenance. We have called this effort "Zuul v5" naming it after the release version that will include this functionality.

The first step towards version 5.0.0 was version 4.0.0 released in February 2021. Version 4.0.0 makes two assertions about the databases that Zuul communicates to. First that the SQL database is always present, and second that the ZooKeeper database communication is always encrypted. These two changes serve as the foundation for the incremental updates necessary to reach version 5.0.0. Importantly, Zuul components rely on these two databases (which themselves can be operated in an HA manner) to store necessary information allowing every Zuul component to run with redundant processes. The encrypted ZooKeeper connectivity is important because Zuul secrets and other sensitive information are stored in the ZooKeeper database which is necessary to run multiple Zuul Scheduler instances.

Seventeen additional version 4.x releases have been made in 2021 ending with 4.11.0. Many of these releases included incremental improvements on the road to version 5.0.0. If you are running 4.11.0 configuration data, secrets, merge requests, build requests, pipeline queues and more are now stored in the ZooKeeper database. This means that adventurous users can now run a fully HA Zuul deployment with no single points of failure on Zuul 4.11.0. However, we have not released version 5.0.0 yet as there are still old components specific to the previous design that need to be removed as well as documentation updates.

This step-wise development approach to the 5.0.0 release has worked well. The branched rewrite for version 3.0.0 was necessary at the time, but was very disruptive for users and made upgrades much harder, a result we were looking to avoid this time around. One major upside to the new approach is that deployments like OpenDev's have been able to more effectively run pre release Zuul updates and provide early feedback. Through Zuul's cooperation with OpenDev we have been able to do this and ensure that each release you consume is ready for use after non trivial real world trials. These same trials ensure that the incremental changes towards version 5.0.0 will all be ready when you upgrade to version 5.0.0 too.

These eighteen releases have brought more than just background operations specific updates; there are new features and bug fixes too. Version 4.6.0 brought a number of important security updates to Zuul that users should be aware of and plan upgrades for if they haven't already. Administrative tasks can be performed through Zuul's REST API using JWT tokens. When version 5.0.0 is released this will be required for administrative tasks as Gearman will be removed. Windows test node support has been greatly improved and is now quite useable. The Zuul Kubernetes operator has migrated to the KOPF operator platform.  The addition of liveness/readiness probes and Prometheus support make running Zuul in Kubernetes easier.

A number of improvements have been made to Nodepool as well. The Azure driver has been rewritten using the new generic driver framework, making it more efficient and adding new features. A metastatic driver was added which allows Nodepool and Zuul to treat dynamic test instances as static nodes, timing them out after periods of inactivity.

To make all of this happen more than 80 contributors submitted changes to 14 project repositories. More than 1000 changes in total were merged to Zuul and its related repositories in 2021. The Zuul project would like to thank all of its contributors for a productive 2021.

The Zuul community saw some interesting changes and events during 2021 as well. Notably, the Zuul synchronous communications platform transitioned from IRC to Matrix. This brings a more modern web experience to chat for Zuul and should be familiar to more people. Matrix is a fully open source platform that stores channel history on the server side which means new participants in Zuul chat can review the entire history of the Matrix room in their client without needing to maintain a persistent connection. Community members also presented at events like [Ansiblefest (requires registration)](https://reg.ansiblefest.redhat.com/flow/redhat/ansible21/regGenAttendee/login), [OpenInfra Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MptrjDKrKhI), and [OpenInfra Live Keynotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyx3KzgT1EE&list=PLKqaoAnDyfgqUEj-Yb36T51uAOKYD08Eb&index=20) whose recordings you can use to learn more about Zuul. Another great starting point is [Zuul's new "Get Started" page](https://zuul-ci.org/start) which includes information about running your own Zuul, finding support, or purchasing a managed Zuul service.

Looking ahead to 2022 we expect version 5.0.0 to be available early in the year. Deployments with additional redundant components can expect better uptime and less painful upgrades. The Zuul documentation is being reorganized to be easier to navigate and include complete information on topics within a single page. IBM cloud support for Nodepool is also in the works. Once version 5.0.0 is finalized, I'm sure we will find a number of exciting new features to focus on as well.

OpenDev believes that free software needs free tools. OpenDev is a collaboratory for open source software development at a huge scale. Its focus is on code review, continuous integration, and project hosting provided exclusively through open source solutions like Git, Gerrit, Zuul, and Gitea.

2021 has been a year of streamlining and improved sustainability for OpenDev. We have converted additional services to our modern configuration management systems including Mailman, Refstack, Kerberos, OpenAFS, and our IRC bots.

A number of services like Mailman, Gerrit, Zuul, and Nodepool have received operating system upgrades on their underlying host systems.  This will help ensure we can continue to run these services well into the future. We have also continued to improve our
"testing like production" CI and CD systems for our services. This enables us to confidently upgrade services like Gerrit, Gitea, Etherpad, Zuul, and more with minimal effort when new versions are released. We bump versions in our Dockerfiles then rely on testing to tell us if everything will deploy to production and run correctly. 

Finally, we've also started to shutdown long running services that no longer receive the necessary attention to continue running in OpenDev. The OpenStackID service
has shifted over to being run by the Open Infrastructure Foundation (Now renamed OpenInfraID), and the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana services for CI job results
are being taken over by OpenStack project contributors within the Testing and Collaboration Tools SIG.

The year had its challenges. The Freenode IRC network which OpenDev relied upon for synchronous communications experienced an ownership change, and subsequent fallout made the platform untenable for our users. The OpenDev team was already maintaining a backup set of channels on the OFTC IRC network. Once our users made the decision to switch networks we quickly mirrored remaining channels, moving bots and copying access control lists to the new network. This necessitated a conversion of our meetbot from the supybot platform to limnoria. A number of our homegrown bots also needed updates to handle different authentication procedures with OFTC. The Covid 19 pandemic continues to create challenges for travel and in person events. The OpenDev team supported the Foundation's 2021 virtual PTG events via our Jitsi Meet based Meetpad service for video conferencing and scheduling via the IRC PTGbot and Ethercalc.

2021 brought new and improved tooling to our users. The Zuul project converted to the open source Matrix platform for communications. The OpenDev team is managing an Element Matrix Services Matrix instance for OpenDev communities now. Matrix rooms hosted on OpenDev's homeserver can make use of our logging and Gerrit bots, but there is no meeting functionality yet. Bindep and git-review saw three new releases. The git-review updates are important as they bring better support for newer Git. A new release of the Gear library was made to accommodate changes to OpenSSL as well.

On the CI front we've made a number of exciting updates. Zuul's Scheduler is no longer a single point of failure in our installation, as OpenDev is continuously deploying the latest Zuul updates and running active-active Zuul Schedulers. In the future this should ensure that Zuul downtimes are rare, and users will no longer need to experience re-enqueued jobs when we perform upgrades. We have added support for CentOS Stream images (both releases 8 and 9), Debian Bullseye, and Euler Linux in our CI system. Users should note that CentOS 8 has reached its End of Life and users should migrate to Stream or some
other platform. We updated the default CI image from Ubuntu Bionic Beaver to Ubuntu Focal Fossa. OpenDev added a second set of ARM64 test resources donated by Oregon State University's Open Source Lab. This means we now have redundant ARM64 test clouds with additional capacity. These resources help test and build packages for OpenStack, Python Cryptography, and more.

Our users had a busy year. 43,874 changes pushed by 1,549 committers were merged on OpenDev in 2021. These changes received 372,084 reviews made by 1,713 reviewers across 966 active project repos. Our users communicate well too. The mailing lists hosted by OpenDev received 9,854 posts from 868 senders. The chat platforms we moderate received 601,175 messages from 2,469 participants.

OpenDev continues to be a community effort. The success of this endeavor relies upon all the people who collaborate to help us out. We would like to thank everyone who made this possible throughout 2021, and welcome those who want to assist in 2022!

## **OpenInfra Community & Mentoring Programs**

#### **[OpenInfra User Groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/openinfradev)**

Helena Spease, Marketing & Community Associate, OpenInfra Foundation

In 2021, we saw 951 new members join various User Groups across the globe. The Indonesia OpenStack User Group experienced the largest growth with 277 new members in 2021.

Amidst challenging circumstances, User Groups showed their commitment to the community by organizing a total of 21 meetups across 9 different groups this past year that reached hundreds in their respective communities. While many User Groups remained virtual, the OpenInfra Lower Saxony User Group and OpenInfra User Group Sweden were able to host a few in-person events. Overall, 2021 saw a mix of virtual, hybrid, and in-person events. The OpenStack and Open Infrastructure Korea User Group even held an event on YouTube Live to close out the year.

#### **Outreachy Program**

Samuel de Medeiros Queiroz, Outreachy Program Coordinator 

Five interns were funded through the Outreachy Program to support the OpenStack project and global community.

* Sunday Mgbogu from Nigeria who added support for OpenStack resources reconciliation in Kuryr-Kubernetes
* Kafilat Adeleke from Nigeria who added support for share types quotas
* cenne.d who exposed boot mode and secure boot status in the Ironic API
* Archana Kumari from India who contributed to OpenStackSDK support for Manila
* Mahnoor A. from Pakistan who worked on auto-Documenting REST API classes for Ironic

#### **Mentorship at Boston University**

Throughout 2021, the relationship between the OpenStack community and Boston University continued to grow through the continued mentorship of three students in the Senior Design course and, in the following semester, in the Fundamentals of Cloud Computing course for undergraduates at Boston University. Both groups of students worked on the OpenStackClient and the OpenStackSDK. 

The Senior Design students worked with the Manila team to get the OpenStackClient closer to parity with the python-manilaclient. The Senior Design Students were Ashley Rodriguez, Mark Tony, and Nicole Chen. Following her completion of the course, Ashley went on to be hired by one of our member companies- Red Hat- and is continuing her work on Manila and the OpenStackClient. 

Students in the Fundamentals of cloud computing course focused on a different storage service- Cinder. They worked on implementing the functionality that the python-cinderclient has into the OpenStackClient. Soon, a new group of students from another university will pick up where they left off furthering the effort. Thanks to Thrivikram Mudunuri, Suneeth Ravi, Diwei Zhu, Ritvik Vinodkumar and Ujjval Sharma, we are making excellent progress towards parity. 

#### **Mentorship at North Dakota State University**

From January through May the OpenStack community participated in North Dakota State University's Capstone course. The course focuses on giving students real world experience by working with industry folks on projects throughout the semester. In 2021, four students were mentored by a few members of the OpenStackSDK/OSC team (Stephen Finucane, Artem Goncharov, and Kendall Nelson) to work on the Cinder implementation in the OpenStackSDK. 

* Hudson Dahly
* James Palmer 
* Alex Wilcox
* Dylan Zapzalka 

Between the four students they pushed a total of 19 patches to the OpenStackSDK and made a lot of progress towards parity with the python-cinderclient. Once the cinder APIs are implemented in the OpenStackSDK, and then the OpenStackClient is extended to include them, the cinderclient can then be deprecated.

In preparation for the next run of the course, both OpenStack and Kata Containers submitted projects for students to chose from and in early 2022, both projects will begin mentoring students for the semester. This will be the first time that Kata is participating in such a program.

#### **Mentorship at Oregon State University**

In 2021 our relationship with Oregon State University continued to flourish The OpenInfra Foundation continues to fund this program to increase the active contributor base, so thanks to the Foundation members who make this possible! We had one student for most of the year, Ryan Zimmerman, working upstream in the OpenStack community. He spent all of his time on reaching parity between the OpenStackSDK and the python-novaclient and succeeded. With his efforts, the groundwork has been laid to now finish the migration from the project specific client to the OpenStackClient. This is part of community wide efforts to migrate all the project specific clients' functionalities to the OpenStackClient simplifying the user experience.

In December, two new students began picking up where Ryan Zimmerman left off. Violet Kurtz and Ryan Persson began onboarding shortly before the end of their school semester. They are now working on using the nova specific APIs implemented in the OpenStackSDK to achieve parity between the python-novaclient with the OpenStackClient. Once they complete the Nova work, they will focus their efforts on doing the same with Cinder. 

#### **OpenStack Upstream Institute**

The training was held twice throughout the year. The first training took place as part of the Open Source Day stand alone event held by the Anita B Foundation who also hosts the Grace Hopper Celebration. The ratio of mentors to students was very high (2:1) which yielded not only a productive day full of good discussions, but a highly specialized experience for the attendees that participated in the event. Upstream Institute was held in a one-day format where the mentors focused on sharing information about the OpenStack community including the tools and processes that contributors use on a daily basis. 

The afternoon section of the training concentrated on hands-on experience where students worked on reproducing and fixing bugs in the OpenStack code base. Attendees who were able to stay for the afternoon learned how to push a code change upstream for review and several of them were able to go above and beyond. They were able to reproduce their bugs and also submit a fix to it. The training was very sucessful and we got great feedback and engagement from students. 

The second training held in 2021 was also an online training that was held as part of the Open Source Day within the Grace Hopper Celebration in October. Similar to the first rendition, the training was held in one-day format with lectures in the morning and hands-on exercises in the afternoon. Again, the students worked on fixing real bugs and the more than 14 mentors made sure that attendees learned the mechanics of uploading a change for review, which is essential to be able to contribute code or documentation after the course. Four attendees pushed patches for bugs that were real fixes to OpenStack and as a result, they entered into a drawing that Grace Hopper was hosting to incentivize working on open source.

While the possibilities to hold the training were again, very limited in 2021, a group of mentors keep maintaining the course material to ensure it is up to date for every training occasion to provide the best experience to the students who joined. The content, being fully open source and available online, provides the possibility for individuals and organizations to go through it as a self-paced course or run it locally.

#### [**OpenInfra Live** ](https://openinfra.live)

Going into the second year of pandemic related travel restrictions and in-person event cancellations, 2021 presented a unique set of challenges to our ongoing efforts to gather and connect as a community. Instead of trying again to recreate the annual in-person Summit virtually in 2021, the Foundation decided to pivot and focus on the good parts of virtual events (engagement, interactivity, and global reach) while trying to steer away from the challenges (difficult to focus on a screen for long periods of time, inability to ask questions, lack of personal interaction). 

We introduced OpenInfra Live in March of 2021, a weekly interactive series covering all things OpenInfra, streaming to YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn every Thursday, as well as being posted to WeChat. To date, we’ve produced over 30 episodes, with an average of 100 live viewers that grows to 1,500 views within the first month of streaming. Over the course of the year, we accumulated over 75,000 views across all episodes of the show, and plan to continue the program in 2021. 

Topics of the weekly episodes included:

* [Explosive Growth of OpenStack Deployments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhMJO82lDxc&list=PLKqaoAnDyfgo5sOi98QlbMVMhgI_lxFPA&index=6&t=471s): The 2021 User Survey showed that the footprint of OpenStack clouds grew by 66% over the last year, totaling over 25 million cores in production. During this episode, operators from Kakao, LINE, Schwarz IT, NeCTAR and T-Systems discuss what’s causing this OpenStack growth at their organization
* [The Role of Open Source in Digital Sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPfo6wXM0BY&list=PLKqaoAnDyfgo5sOi98QlbMVMhgI_lxFPA&index=23&t=2s): Johan Christenson, CEO of CityNetwork, hosted a discussion around the role of open source in digital sovereignty between Pierre Gronlier, CTO of Gaia-X, Kurt Garloff, CTO at Sovereign Cloud Stack, and Linda Siwe, chief commercial officer at Binero.
  The Future of Network Depends on Open Infrastructure: Martin Casado, Bruce Davie and Amar Padmanabhan joined Jonathan Bryce and Mark Collier to discuss the opportunities around connecting the globe, including leveraging open source technologies like Magma, software-based RAN and OpenStack.
* [Large Scale OpenStack series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKqaoAnDyfgpnPTSJ8MY4SNEU6UlQQRfs): Over the course of the year, we developed a series of episodes featuring members of the Large Scale SIG discussing issues faced by operators running OpenStack at scale. As an example, in July operators of OpenStack-based large scale clouds (including InMotion Hosting, CERN, NECTAR research cloud, Verizon Media, City Network and Open Telekom Cloud) joined to discuss how they manage [spare capacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7oN2XdI__k&list=PLKqaoAnDyfgo5sOi98QlbMVMhgI_lxFPA&index=21&t=3s). 

With the help of Foundation members and event sponsors, partners, and the support of the entire Community, we were able to continue our mission to collaborate, share knowledge, network, and continue improving the software with a broad global reach despite the continued challenges of the year.

All episodes of OpenInfra Live from 2021 are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKqaoAnDyfgo5sOi98QlbMVMhgI_lxFPA).

#### **[OpenInfra Live: Keynotes](https://openinfra.dev/live/keynotes)**

On November 17th and 18th, the Foundation hosted its first two-day virtual event featuring presentations by more than 30 leaders from the global OpenInfra community streaming live on YouTube, LinkedIn and Facebook. Both days of Keynotes were also streamed to SegmentFault, a China-focused platform. Keynote topics covered a broad range of OpenInfra use cases, and projects like OpenStack and Kubernetes took center stage. 

The OpenInfra Live Keynotes event featured:

* Jonathan Bryce and Mark Collier discussed [LOKI stack](https://openinfra.dev/blog/loki-openinfra-standard-linux-openstack-kubernetes)—Linux OpenStack Kubernetes Infrastructure—highlighting the trend of organizations integrating three of the top four most active open source projects together in production.
* Balaji Srinivasan (Entrepreneur, Crypto Expert, Former Partner at a16z and CTO of Coinbase) talked about the need to decentralize at the infrastructure layer, which removes the “trust factor” requirement of the operator because the entire backend is not only open source, but also open state and open execution.
* Sarah Novotny (Director of Open Source Strategy & Ecosystem, Microsoft) detailed the key patterns for success when companies engage in open source communities, as well as trends we should watch for over the next decade of open source.
* Thierry Carrez (VP of Engineering, OpenInfra Foundation) provided updates on the state of open infrastructure and how the Foundation’s scope expanded to getting infrastructure powered by open source software everywhere. Other Day Two speakers included: 
  Martin Casado (Partner, Andreessen Horowitz) joined to discuss the cost of cloud and how it is impacting the economics of cloud-native companies.
* Haoyang Li (OpenInfra Foundation) provided an update on what the open infrastructure landscape looks like in China.
  Representatives from each of the OpenInfra projects joined to discuss current happenings in each of their Communities

A huge thank you to our Headline sponsors Red Hat and Wind River, and our Supporting sponsors, Cloud & Heat, Component Soft, Coredge, InMotion Hosting, iVolve and Vexxhost.

#### **[Project Teams Gathering (PTG)](https://openinfra.dev/ptg)**

After the success of the first virtual PTGs in 2020, we decided to continue that format into the 2021 PTGs since the potential to host in-person events was still questionable.

Both the April and October 2021 PTG welcomed over 500 registered attendees from 46 countries. The April PTG hosted 47 project teams, and the October PTG had 49 teams participate, including two new OpenStack projects, Venus and Skyline. The teams met throughout the week in 2-4 hour increments at times that worked best for their team members.

The PTGbot was a successful scheduling tool once again, helping participants and teams keep track of discussions and virtual meeting locations. 

Many teams publish a recap of their PTG discussions and future technical plans. You can check out some of those recaps here:

#### **OpenInfra Days & Cloud Operator Days**

OpenInfra Days are one or two day regional events organized by the local community and supported by the OpenInfra Foundation to include project workshops, upstream training, and booths from the local ecosystem. These events continue to be an excellent touchstone for the community to engage with our ecosystem, and to gather local open source developers and users to collaborate, share use cases, and support for the OpenInfra projects.

Several communities hosted both virtual and in-person events this year, spanning across the globe, including two first-time events:

* OpenInfra Days DR Congo
* OpenInfra Days Asia

OpenInfra Days Asia was a combined effort from User Groups in multiple regions, championed by OpenInfra Foundation board member, Rico Lin. 

Other events include:

* OpenInfra Days Indonesia
* OpenInfra Days China
* OpenInfra Community Days Korea
* Cloud Operator Day Tokyo

In a unique approach, the second annual Cloud Operator Days took place throughout the month of August with on demand sessions online, leading up to a two day live online event, complete with keynotes, that gathered 2,000 attendees to discuss challenges of operating cloud infrastructure.

The OpenInfra Foundation supported and sponsored each of these events. Overall, the events drew over 100,000 attendees virtually.

## **OpenInfra Special Interest Groups (SIGs) & Working Groups**

#### **[Large Scale SIG](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Large_Scale_SIG)**

The Large Scale SIG is an OpenStack special interest group gathering operators of large scale OpenStack deployments interested in sharing their experience and discussing best practices. The group has been meeting regularly this year, with about 6 people forming the core group and a dozen of other people more infrequently involved.

One output of the group is the Scaling Journey: a set of wiki pages that describe the various stages of scaling your OpenStack deployments from tens of nodes or tens of thousands of nodes. That path was traveled by a lot of operators before, but lack of documentation and practical experience sharing still makes it a daunting prospect. The goal of the SIG is to document frequently asked questions and answers, as well as point to relevant resources, to make that journey as predictable and pleasant as possible.

Another focus of the Large Scale SIG this year was the “Large Scale OpenStack” show, a recurring event on the OpenInfra Live webcast. We invited operators of large scale deployments and got them to present how they solve a given operations challenge, and discuss live between themselves their different approaches. We tackled topics like upgrades in large scale environments, spare capacity handling, software-defined supercomputers, scaling Neutron, as well as operators tricks and tools. This show was amongst the most popular episodes on OpenInfra Live, and our goal is to continue in 2022.

#### Scientific SIG

The Scientific SIG continues to be co-chaired by Martial Michel (DataMachines), Stig Telfer (StackHPC) and Blair Bethwaite (NeSI).  Membership of the SIG is growing, with 136 members joined to a Slack workspace ([os-scientific-sig.slack.com](https://os-scientific-sig.slack.com)).

In 2021, SIG members have participated (virtually) in the Project Teams Gathering.  A highlight has been the recording of lightning talks given by SIG members at the PTG sessions.  [Twelve lightning talks from two PTG sessions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKqaoAnDyfgoVlX5TxZVwSDCTnx81a7-z) have been uploaded to the OpenInfra Foundation's YouTube channel.

However, SIG community participation could improve, with minimal use of the openstack-discuss mailing list and only occasional use of the scheduled IRC meetings.

#### **Bare Metal SIG**

During 2021, the Bare Metal Special Interest Group focused on outreach and information sharing. We had a number of contributors present features in Ironic and their use cases which drove those specific features to be developed. A number of these monthly presentations were recorded and shared on Youtube. The SIG also utilized sessions to provide input into the next development cycles prior to the development community meeting to plan and discuss the work ahead. Perhaps the most powerful lesson that we learned this year is that we needed to actively reach out and spread the word of the SIG. Visibility is sometimes difficult to gain upfront, and ultimately the power in the SIG is in getting contributors and operators to meet and discuss. It takes everyone broadcasting outwards to make this happen, but the outcomes can be magical.

#### **Diversity & Inclusion Working Group**

The Diversity and Inclusion Working Group continued reaching out to the OIF projects and inviting them to join our efforts and expand beyond the OpenStack project. To date we have been most successful in this effort during the virtual PTGs and hope a return to in person events will help these efforts.

After approval and the move to the new OpenInfra site, the Divisive Language stance was added to the Wiki and linked to the word list already created. We have reached out over the year and invited all projects to join meetings or PTG sessions for help on this initiative. As part of this work, the WG audited the Foundation's governance and By-Laws and made recommendations to  update outdated language.

The D&I WG also helped to lead OpenStack's presence during Grace Hopper's Open Source Days. This year there was a standalone event in addition to the event held with the main conference and we had approximately 12-14 mentors aiding attendees during these events.

In addition, several of the questions developed by the WG for our own Diversity and Inclusion WG were included in the Linux Foundation's DEI survey.

In 2022, we plan on continuing to aid the OIF projects in their efforts to remove divisive language and to use more inclusive words. We also hope to be able to resume efforts with the community during virtual and in person events.

#### **Interop Working Group**

The OpenInfra Interop Working Group has been issuing guidelines for OpenStack Logos and Branding programs as part of Marketplace development every release. The programs which can be issued currently are as follows:

**Core programs**

* OpenStack Powered Platform
* OpenStack Powered Compute
* OpenStack Powered Object Storage

**Add-on programs**

* OpenStack Powered DNS
* OpenStack Powered Orchestration
* OpenStack Powered Shared File System

Last year we merged Interop and refstack into a single WG and transitioned sources to opendev. We released only one new guideline instead of 2 (1 per each development cycle as was done before) due to a lot of work we had to invest into the IWG group reformation, tooling and documentation updates. The new guideline was formed in November, hence the name 2021.11. It contains the most new test and capability additions out of the guidelines released within a few last years.

Marketplace page is now capable of showing add-on logos as some vendors have started testing against these add-on programs and their marketplace entries reflect it.  The interop working group guidelines will not be validating API micro-versions. In order to increase transparency, we plan on publishing the micro versions tested against guidelines, in the Marketplace reports.

During the year 2021 we received feedback about the program naming from vendors and users. It has been brought to our attention that dividing the programs to core ones and add-on ones suggests a certain inequality which is not the case. Another issue with the current program definition is that the OpenStack Platform logo program requires Cinder service to be enabled in the tested cloud, however, the service is not required and a functioning OpenStack compute cloud doesn’t need to have one.

In the 2022 we want to focus on adding a new program for octavia service. Also, we want to address the raised concerns about program naming conventions. We plan to brainstorm and discuss possible solutions which would clear the naming confusion without any significant changes of the conditions for getting our current logos.

## Marketing Performance

#### Media Relations and Analyst Relations

Public relations efforts are led by a distributed team of professionals in the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. This team engaged analysts and journalists worldwide in dialogue, proactively delivering news, commentary, and contributed byline content for both the Foundation and for its individual projects. Community news highlights are available at <https://openinfra.dev/press/>.

**Media Relations**

Virtual press conferences were held in April and October to brief journalists on the evolution of the Foundation, the status of individual projects supported by the OpenInfra community, and efforts to collaborate without boundaries. In addition, the PR team conducted proactive outreach for these key events and initiatives: 

* OpenInfra Foundation seats first Board of Directors 
* OpenInfra Foundation 2021 event agenda
* Red Hat support of Open Research Cloud Initiative/OpenInfra Labs
* OpenInfra Foundation Associate Memberships
* Microsoft Platinum Membership
* OpenInfra Live: Keynotes and OpenInfra Summit Berlin 2022
* Taibai
* Nipa Cloud Gold Membership
* Growth of OpenInfra software adoption
* Project software releases: 
* * OpenStack Wallaby and Xena releases
  * Airship 2.0
  * StarlingX 5.0

Analysis shows that Open Infrastructure Foundation news coverage comprised more than 26,699 total placements in 2021. Media coverage was distributed globally (41% APAC, 49% North America, 10% Europe, by volume).

**Analyst Relations**

In 2021, the Open Infrastructure Foundation continued the virtual analyst briefing format that had been established in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the course of the year, Foundation staff leadership conducted both group and individual briefing sessions, providing updates to more than 21 analysts in Asia, North America, and Europe. Firms with strong ongoing interest in our community’s work include 451 Research, ARC Advisory Group, AvidThink, Constellation Research, IDC, Forrester, Gartner, Omdia, Redmonk and others.

Analyst interest in the community’s work has shifted steadily since the early days of the Foundation. While early coverage necessarily focused on the OpenStack project, the focus has broadened substantially to include other projects supported by the Open Infrastructure Foundation. Additionally, coverage has shifted to include Open Infrastructure Foundation projects as components of broad-based solutions that leverage open infrastructure technologies such as Kubernetes.
