#### **Empowering A Global Community to Overcome Open Source Threats**

***Jonathan Bryce, Executive Director, OpenInfra Foundation***

I can't recall a time in my life when the principles of open source have faced more significant threats than today. The landscape is rife with challenges such as fears surrounding new technologies, especially in the realm of AI, and a pervasive misunderstanding of the risks that open source may pose to supply chain security. These concerns have led to policies and regulatory proposals that pose the risk of overregulating open source, hamstringing our communities, and stifling the very innovation that open source has come to represent.

Adding to this, the global rise of nationalism poses complex and formidable risks to global collaboration—the very essence that has fueled the success and impact of open source on a global scale.

Yet, despite these challenges, I remain tremendously optimistic about the future of open source and open infrastructure. Throughout past challenges, open source has not only weathered storms but has emerged stronger. Indeed, open source is more pervasive and integral to our lives than ever before. Ironically, the very technologies that instill fear also harbor the potential to unlock unprecedented innovation and positive impacts on humanity. Open source—specifically, open infrastructure—is the best way to unlock that potential while maintaining transparency.

So, here we stand at a pivotal moment in history, and the question arises: How can the OpenInfra Foundation make a difference?

**Empowering Our Global Community**

Our strength lies in our community—560+ organizations and over 110,000 individuals spanning 180 countries. We've embarked on regional initiatives, with the launch of OpenInfra Asia and OpenInfra Europe hubs. Both organizations have now seated their advisory boards and are poised to amplify our collective voice on policy issues and spearhead strong regional community growth. Additionally, our support of the Open Policy Alliance strengthens our commitment to open source initiatives, as does our support of the Open Source Initiative, particularly its recent leadership in defining Open Source AI.

**Creating Opportunities for Collaboration**

In-person meetings remain indispensable, and the 2023 OpenInfra Summit in Vancouver was an example of that. Attendees from 50 countries and 335 organizations, with 45% attending for the first time, were inspired by keynotes featuring cutting-edge topics from industry leaders. Looking ahead, 2024 promises a regional OpenInfra Asia Summit and a special edition OpenInfra Days series throughout Europe, fostering more opportunities for collaboration.

**Project Support**

Our commitment to supporting communities remains unwavering. OpenStack, Kata Containers, StarlingX, Zuul, Airship, OpenInfra Labs, and OpenDev continue to receive our support. Notably, our new initiative, Directed Funding, enables OpenInfra members to contribute directly to the specific projects that resonate with them, ensuring sustained growth and innovation.

<ul/>

As we navigate the complex landscape of 2024, our community's strength, innovative capacity, and resilience are our greatest assets. The achievements highlighted in this report bear testament to what we've accomplished together in the past year. This should remind us of our collective potential and be a source of inspiration for addressing the challenges that lie ahead.

I have no doubt that in the face of new threats, the OpenInfra community will embrace the opportunities to innovate, collaborate and strengthen the foundation of open source. Together, we can continue to shape a future where openness and collaboration lead to groundbreaking advancements.

Thank you for another great year. Here's to many more.

#### **Note from the Chair of the OpenInfra Foundation Board of Directors**

***Julia Kreger, Board Chair*** 

When looking back at the past year, it is impossible to ignore just how difficult this year has been. It is also difficult to put into words. Many involved with open source seek to leverage the open source commons to solve the problem or challenge before them. Often, we seek to leave things in a better state than when we found them to make the path easier for those who come after us.

However, we live in a changing world where the power and capabilities of open source entices its use, and increases its visibility for government regulation as an economic alternative. The uncertainty of pending and in-process regulation creates an environment where we also tend to change the way we think as uncertainty is a source of stress.

That is before we consider the stress that is upon contributors due to conflict outside of their control. Similarly, rumors of regulations under discussion which may hamper future collaboration also create stress.

But we also live in an exciting time where technological possibilities are evolving rapidly and the need for open source infrastructure software is stronger than ever. As technology evolves, especially in a time of high visibility for technology, it is only natural for there to be a heightened level of scrutiny and regulation. The key challenge is recognizing, evolving and responding to the challenges before us.

One challenge has been the issue of regional context. The need to share that context has been why we rotate our events from region to region. Historically, when one regional context does not match another, discussions can lose velocity due to a lack of mutual understanding. This is one of the reasons why we launched the regional hubs, OpenInfra Europe and OpenInfra Asia, to help incubate and spread the context.

The regional hubs are also well-timed because this year we’ve come to understand that the pandemic greatly changed how willing contributors are to travel great distances and that has forced a re-evaluation of our events strategy. We now foresee local organizers as the key driving force to an event’s success, as they can help bridge a regional context to an event far better than someone on the other side of the planet can.

Simplification of a past process seems to be a repeating theme for us this past year. Another great example of that and one of which I’m very proud of is simplifying special casing in the OpenInfra Foundation’s bylaws. The Board of Directors worked to simplify these bylaws because they were written at a different time and now that the world has evolved, the updates will better enable staff and contributors to navigate the challenges ahead. 

And that is a simplification of a past process, which has become a repeating theme for us this past year. Another great example that I’m very proud of is the Board of Directors simplifying special casing in the bylaws because the Foundation’s bylaws were written at a different time and the world has evolved. The updates will better enable the staff and contributors to navigate the challenges ahead.

While I speak of the challenges ahead, this year we have seen increased adoption of our projects, which continue to move forward with bug fixes and features on a regular cadence. 

And while I speak of challenges ahead, for there are always challenges ahead, this year we have seen increased adoption of our projects. Our projects continue to move forward with bug fixes and features on a regular cadence.

It is easy to let stress and uncertainty fog the road before us and hinder our ability to move forward. Something we need to remember is that we need to continue to progress even though change can be hard. After all, we are our own advocates to facilitate change. Remember to listen and be part of the discussion. Spread the good word about your work. Share the context of the projects in which you work and why. Help make the world a better place by embracing simplicity and positive change! 

We just have to remember that we need to continue to move forward. Change is hard, and we are, after all, our own best advocates to facilitate change. Remember to listen and be part of the discussion! I encourage you to take part! Spread the good word about your works! Share the context of the projects in which you work and why! Help make the world a better place by embracing simplicity and positive change!

#### **State of OpenInfra**

***Thierry Carrez, General Manager, OpenInfra Foundation***

We started 2023 with three goals for the OpenInfra Foundation. The first one was about increasing regional collaboration opportunities. OpenInfra is truly global, but each region has slightly different priorities and challenges. How to make sure that those concerns are heard and reflected in the global organization strategy?

We decided to create two regional hubs, one in [Europe](https://openinfraeurope.org/) and one in [Asia](https://openinfraasia.org/), to help bridge the regional issues with the global organization. OpenInfra member organizations can participate in their regional hub at no additional cost. Each hub has an Advisory Board composed of regional OpenInfra leaders to help drive the feedback loop from the region to the global organization. Beyond that, we also decided to overhaul our event strategy, evolving from global events to a more regional approach that is more in tune with the current state of conference travel. The end result of those changes is that there will be more and more opportunities for our members to collaborate at the regional level.

This feeds into the second goal for the year, which was about increasing member engagement and satisfaction. Our regional hubs provide additional opportunities to engage, collaborate or raise concerns. We organized strategic workshops in Vancouver and Beijing. Foundation staff traveled all around the world to meet with our members and communities in China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, France, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands... This was challenging, but also necessary as for some of those countries we did not have any opportunity to visit our members since the pandemic.

Finally, our third goal was to onboard projects through the new project fund model that we created in 2022. We engaged with OSPOs at major companies and OpenInfra is now clearly positioned as an option for organizations willing to launch new open collaborations around infrastructure software. We are currently talking to potential founding organizations for several project funds, but building the critical mass to make it happen sustainably takes time. We hope to be able to announce the good news early in 2024.

Overall it was a very busy year for OpenInfra! 2023 was challenging for open source in general, with new threats to our open collaboration model that need to be addressed and countered. With your help and support, we will continue to fight the good fight in 2024!

### Introducing OpenInfra Regional Hubs

***Wes Wilson, VP of Operations, OpenInfra Foundation***

This year, the OpenInfra Foundation announced the formation of two new regional hubs, OpenInfra Europe and OpenInfra Asia. These hubs were created with the purpose of promoting and protecting the open source communities and technologies in these regions where the OpenInfra community has rapidly expanded. These hubs provide opportunities for the Foundation to gather more input from a regional perspective, helping to influence regional and global actions. They also provide a mechanism for regional output, through event coordination and local representation. Participating organizations of both hubs gather together in:

* Advancing open source infrastructure in the region
* Discussing regional strategic issues
* Gathering regional feedback and elevating local voices
* Coordinating local communities and events
* Conducting regional business development and market research
* Providing local programs for nurturing the next generation of open source contributors 

#### OpenInfra Europe

The global open source landscape has proven to be both challenged and grown through the activity that has taken place in Europe over the past several years. Given their impact on open infrastructure and involvement in the OpenInfra Foundation, establishing a regional hub in Europe was an obvious decision. Participating organizations represent over ten countries and have quickly organized to address the unique and valuable European landscape. Some of their initial priorities are protecting the essence of true open source collaboration in the face of new regulations, growing the regional ecosystem, and accelerating cloud and container technologies. OpenInfra Europe is a Belgian nonprofit association, supported by participating organizations including OpenInfra Gold and Platinum members Ericsson, Canonical, Cleura, Deutsche Telecom and more.
