# **2024 — A Very Good Year for OpenInfra**
***Jonathan Bryce, Executive Director, OpenInfra Foundation***

In retrospect, 2024  turned out to be a much more exciting year for Open Infrastructure than I anticipated. At the OpenInfra Foundation, we made tremendous progress toward our 2024 goals of protecting the OpenInfra vision of open source, supporting and strengthening our projects, and increasing OpenInfra’s impact. This progress is well documented in the following report, but let me call out a few reasons why I am particularly energized by how the OpenInfra community progressed this year.

First, we’re seeing a resurgence of support and adoption among organizations and individuals who wholeheartedly embrace the freedom and innovation that only open source collaboration provides. Although a few disappointing instances of “anti-open source” behavior have darkened the skies, the silver lining has been a catalyzed community of open source advocates who are letting their voices be heard and investing their time and resources to support open source projects. At the OpenInfra Foundation, we’ve documented substantial growth among all three “forces.” For example, developers continue to add powerful capabilities to our projects to support new workloads such as AI and accelerated hardware; users are driving massive demand for OpenStack and Kata Containers; and the ecosystem of companies providing OpenInfra products and services have created migration solutions to assist companies looking for alternatives to previously entrenched proprietary technology.

Second, the OpenInfra community is stepping up to meet the moment on regional challenges and opportunities. Our regional hubs—OpenInfra Europe and OpenInfra Asia—are actively engaged in addressing unique regional issues around open source. In addition, 2024 marked the launch of regional summits organized “by the community, for the community,” highlighted by a highly successful, sold-out OpenInfra Summit Asia in Suwon, South Korea. The community also stepped up to host dozens of OpenInfra Days and community events throughout Europe, Asia and North America.

Third, the OpenInfra community is having a very tangible impact on shaping the future. This year, we contributed to the effort to define Open Source AI, advocating for permissionless innovation in the spirit of The Four Opens. We also added our voice to regional legislative discussions regarding digital sovereignty and licensing. Most importantly, the support delivered by project teams around AI workloads, hardware enablement, ever-evolving security needs, and improved user experience clearly demonstrates how the OpenInfra community is committed to providing infrastructure not only for today’s demands but also for the revolutionary technological advancements yet to come. 

It’s been a truly great year! And together we can make 2025 even better as we work together to deliver the OpenInfra software that drives the global economy and human progress.

# **Protecting OpenInfra Vision of Open Source**

One of the OpenInfra Foundation’s key goals for 2024 was to act to protect OpenInfra’s vision of open source: an incredible engine to drive innovation forward and make it accessible to everyone. This vision is being challenged by a broad set of drivers, including geopolitical tensions, incoming regulation, licensing changes on single-vendor open source projects, and actors diluting the meaning of “open source” by applying it to any publicly released AI model.

The OpenInfra Foundation staff and community actively collaborated to address these challenges through various efforts including: 

<ul>
<li>Addressing upcoming regulations</li>
<li>Promoting permissionless innovation</li>
<li>Pushing community-produced open source</li>
<li>Furthering diversity and inclusion in open source communities</li>
<li>Positioning OpenInfra software as a digital public good</li>
<li>Promoting open, collaborative software development along with individual contributors</li>
</ul>

# **Addressing Upcoming Regulations**

In 2024, the OpenInfra Foundation was actively involved in defending open source specificity as it was challenged by upcoming regulations, most notably by the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) in the European Union (EU). Foundation staff participated in several key events, including OpenForum Europe’s EU Open Source Policy Summit, FOSDEM’s “Open Source In The European Legislative Landscape” room, and the Open Source Congress. This allowed us to add our voice to that of other organizations in pushing back against certain provisions of the CRA. As a result, the final adopted text is now much more understanding of the specificities of open source developed as an open collaboration under the auspices of an open source steward.

The CRA process is now addressing how to define the "harmonized standards," which translate the requirements set out in the regulation into detailed technical specifications. To follow and influence that critical work, the OpenInfra Foundation joined the [Open Regulatory Compliance working group](https://orcwg.org/) (hosted by the Eclipse Foundation) as a founding member, and Jeremy Stanley, senior principal engineer at the OpenInfra Foundation, has been elected to its Specification Committee as a Foundation member representative.

The OpenInfra Foundation and its regional hubs also follow other incoming regulations in the EU, Asia and the United States. Increasing regulation of open source is a testament to its success, but we must stay vigilant to make sure that legislators understand the specificities and benefits of open source and do not negate them inadvertently due to a lack of understanding.

# **Promoting Permissionless Innovation**
One key aspect of OpenInfra’s vision of open source is that it enables permissionless innovation. The absence of friction in accessing technology creates the enormous demand-side value of open source, estimated at $8.8 trillion by a recent [Harvard Business School study](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230). This permissionless innovation aspect has been challenged in various ways by organizations claiming to “do open source” without allowing everyone to use the project or its results for any purpose.

We have seen this particularly with new software licenses that claim to be open but contain fuzzy noncompete clauses which make it impossible to build upon. OpenInfra staff is involved with the Open Source Initiative (OSI) where Thierry Carrez, general manager of the OpenInfra Foundation, sits as vice-chair, to defend the Open Source Definition in all of its dimensions. OpenInfra Foundation staff members have been engaging in conversations with the media to denounce those so-called open licenses and the danger that they pose to permissionless innovation. In addition, Mark Collier, chief operating officer of the OpenInfra Foundation, was [engaged](https://opensource.org/blog/mark-collier-voices-of-the-open-source-ai-definition) in OSI’s efforts to establish an Open Source AI definition, helping to ensure that the permissionless innovation aspect of open source software extends to this new field.

# **Pushing Community-Produced Open Source**
Another key aspect of OpenInfra’s vision of open source is that it is produced as a commons, by a community of participants on a level playing field. Unfortunately, over the past few years, we have seen many open source promises broken and restrictive relicensing of open source software by companies that had full control over a given project.

The OpenInfra Foundation pushed back, advocating for the additional sustainability and value of community-produced open source. For example, Thierry Carrez, general manager at the OpenInfra Foundation, delivered at [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2190-single-vendor-is-the-new-proprietary/) and OW2Con a presentation called “Single vendor is the new proprietary,” which was [later published](https://opensource.net/why-single-vendor-is-the-new-proprietary/) on [opensource.net](https://opensource.net). He also clarified the role of open source foundations in the ecosystem, focusing on this topic in a presentation at the OpenInfra Summit Asia in Suwon.

# **Furthering Diversity & Inclusion in Open Source Communities**
Increasing the diversity of collaboration in its many forms — personal, cultural, geographic and professional — is an ongoing challenge in open source software communities, and supporting improvements in diversity and inclusion is a key activity for the OpenInfra Foundation. In 2024, the community introduced a new [Diversity Portal](https://openinfra.org/about/diversity) highlighting efforts of the board-chartered Diversity and Inclusion Working Group, including the revision of the [Diversity Survey](https://openinfrafoundation.formstack.com/forms/openinfra_diversity_inclusion) as a significant product of the group’s work for the year. Throughout 2024, diversity and inclusion representatives led Forum, PTG and OpenInfra Days sessions discussing related challenges within OpenInfra project communities and identifying future tasks for overall improvement.

This year the OpenInfra Foundation also continued collaborating with diversity and inclusion organizations to recruit new, diverse talent. The OpenInfra Foundation sponsored one Outreachy intern for the OpenStack community and collaborated with the AnitaB Foundation to host a Level Up Lab. The Lab focused on educating the AnitaB Foundation’s global woman-centered community on being involved in an open source community and the basics of getting started contributing to OpenStack. This was the start of a deeper collaboration in supporting their newer investment into education around open source. 

Additional efforts were put into place to accommodate the geographical diversity of the OpenInfra community, given that community members reside in 187 countries. In addition to using asynchronous communication via mailing lists, the OpenInfra community evolved the virtual Project Teams Gatherings to increase accessibility by expanding time zone availabilities that accommodate several regions. 

The OpenInfra Foundation continues to encourage community teams to schedule their own time during the PTG. This allows organizers to accommodate the geographic locations (and preferred time zones and work schedules) of active participants on a particular team.

# **Positioning OpenInfra as a Digital Public Good**
Open Infrastructure software has a key role to play in enabling digital sovereignty and local infrastructure all around the world. To that effect, the OpenInfra Foundation staff has been working to position OpenInfra software as a Digital Public Good, aligned with the U.N.’s [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). This includes providing feedback to the ‘How to master Europe’s digital infrastructure needs?’ white paper, pointing to the role of open infrastructure in addressing those needs and endorsing the [U.N. Global Digital Compact](https://www.un.org/global-digital-compact), which is aligned with the OpenInfra mission of making key infrastructure technologies available to all.

# **Promoting Open, Collaborative Software Development along with Individual Contributors** 
The OpenInfra Foundation has been providing marketing and outreach support for a podcast hosted by Ildikó Vancsa, director of community at the OpenInfra Foundation, and Phil Robb, OpenInfra Foundation board member. [My Open Source Experience podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@MyOpenSourceExperience) aims to uncover challenges, good and bad practices, and success stories throughout the open source ecosystem. The content of this podcast serves as a resource for OpenInfra and other open source communities around the globe.
Ildikó and Phil have been running their podcast since October 2023 and began their second season in September 2024. The podcast features prominent figures and contributors from the OpenInfra community and the open source ecosystem at large.
During the discussions, Ildikó and Phil dive into important topics with their guests, including the bait-and-switch business model, license changes, single-vendor open source projects, the importance of servant leadership, and more.
