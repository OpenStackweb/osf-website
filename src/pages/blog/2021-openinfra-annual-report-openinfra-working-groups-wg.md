#### **DIVERSITY & INCLUSION WORKING GROUP**

The Diversity and Inclusion Working Group continued reaching out to the OIF projects and inviting them to join our efforts and expand beyond the OpenStack project. To date we have been most successful in this effort during the virtual PTGs and hope a return to in person events will help these efforts.

After approval and the move to the new OpenInfra site, the Divisive Language stance was added to the Wiki and linked to the word list already created. We have reached out over the year and invited all projects to join meetings or PTG sessions for help on this initiative. As part of this work, the WG audited the Foundation's governance and By-Laws and made recommendations to update outdated language.

The D&I WG also helped to lead OpenStack's presence during Grace Hopper's Open Source Days. This year there was a standalone event in addition to the event held with the main conference and we had approximately 12-14 mentors aiding attendees during these events.

In addition, several of the questions developed by the WG for our own Diversity and Inclusion WG were included in the Linux Foundation's DEI survey.

In 2022, we plan on continuing to aid the OIF projects in their efforts to remove divisive language and to use more inclusive words. We also hope to be able to resume efforts with the community during virtual and in person events.

#### **INTEROP WORKING GROUP**

The OpenInfra Interop Working Group has been issuing guidelines for OpenStack Logos and Branding programs as part of Marketplace development every release. The programs which can be issued currently are as follows:

**Core programs**

* OpenStack Powered Platform
* OpenStack Powered Compute
* OpenStack Powered Object Storage

**Add-on programs**

* OpenStack Powered DNS
* OpenStack Powered Orchestration
* OpenStack Powered Shared File System

Last year we merged Interop and refstack into a single WG and transitioned sources to opendev. We released only one new guideline instead of 2 (1 per each development cycle as was done before) due to a lot of work we had to invest into the IWG group reformation, tooling and documentation updates. The new guideline was formed in November, hence the name 2021.11. It contains the most new test and capability additions out of the guidelines released within a few last years.

Marketplace page is now capable of showing add-on logos as some vendors have started testing against these add-on programs and their marketplace entries reflect it. The interop working group guidelines will not be validating API micro-versions. In order to increase transparency, we plan on publishing the micro versions tested against guidelines, in the Marketplace reports.

During the year 2021 we received feedback about the program naming from vendors and users. It has been brought to our attention that dividing the programs to core ones and add-on ones suggests a certain inequality which is not the case. Another issue with the current program definition is that the OpenStack Platform logo program requires Cinder service to be enabled in the tested cloud, however, the service is not required and a functioning OpenStack compute cloud doesn’t need to have one.

In the 2022 we want to focus on adding a new program for octavia service. Also, we want to address the raised concerns about program naming conventions. We plan to brainstorm and discuss possible solutions which would clear the naming confusion without any significant changes of the conditions for getting our current logos.
