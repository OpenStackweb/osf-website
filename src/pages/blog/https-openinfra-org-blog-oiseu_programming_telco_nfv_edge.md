We are very excited to announce the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) Programming Committee!

The OpenInfra Summit Europe prides itself on being built for the community, by the community! This means that the CFP review and schedule building process is completed by [volunteers from the OpenInfra community](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/who-we-are/) to drive the direction of the OpenInfra Summit!

The OpenInfra Summit Programming Committee is led by Amy Marrich who will be leading 30+ committee members in the review and schedule building process. Below you will find details on the various programming committee members as well as the kind of content they are interested in seeing.

The OpenInfra Summit Europe will take place at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique Campus in Paris, France, October 17-19, 2025! The CFP closes June 13 at 23:59 UTC.
