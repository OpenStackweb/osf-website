The last of OpenInfra Foundation’s key goals for 2024 was to increase OpenInfra’s impact. We reviewed all of our activities with an eye toward reinforcing the OpenInfra brand and increasing awareness and participation around the OpenInfra mission.

To achieve this, the OpenInfra Foundation staff and community dedicated time to:

* Reaching more people through online and offline methods
* Growing the OpenInfra ecosystem to address software demand
* Advancing OpenInfra in [Europe](openinfraeurope.org) and [Asia](openinfraasia.org) regions
* Elevating the OpenInfra Brand
* Positioning OpenInfra within the broader open source ecosystem
