# The Global Leaders Powering the Future of Open Source Infrastructure

Last month, [the OpenInfra Foundation officially joined forces with the Linux Foundation](https://openinfra.org/blog/openinfra-joins-linux-foundation), accelerating open source innovation and collaboration. With this change, the OpenInfra Foundation mission remains the same: building communities who write open source infrastructure software that runs in production. 

Over 80 organizations have joined the OpenInfra Foundation to further this mission and increase adoption and awareness of OpenInfra projects, [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/), [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/), and [Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/). Thierry Carrez, GM of the OpenInfra Foundation, recently [shared his vision](https://openinfra.org/blog/openinfra-vision) for how this mission will shape the next generation of open source infrastructure. These organizations are instrumental in this next chapter as we build technologies that meet the infrastructure needs of the next 15 years. 

Meet these leaders and learn how your organization can join this opportunity as we build the next chapter of open source infrastructure software.

# OpenDev: Free software needs free tools

* Zuul test node images are now configured through the [zuul-providers repo](https://opendev.org/opendev/zuul-providers) and not the [project-config repo](https://opendev.org/openstack/project-config/src/branch/master/nodepool). This change allows us to test updates to the image builds before they are deployed and used by Zuul. Details for specific image builds and uploads can be found in the [Zuul dashboard](https://zuul.opendev.org/t/openstack/images).
* Debian Trixie and CentOS Stream 10 test nodes have been added. Start testing the new Debian Trixie release now.
* The OpenDev team is considering using Matrix for team communications. Weigh in on the [spec here](https://review.opendev.org/c/opendev/infra-specs/+/954826).

# StarlingX: A fully featured cloud for the distributed edge

* The StarlingX community has finished configuring servers provided by Arm in the community lab made available by Wind River Systems. They are now working on enabling Arm support in the StarlingX platform.

# Zuul: Stop merging broken code

* No new Zuul releases have been published since 12.1.0, but work continues on some important efforts. The [Nodepool in Zuul spec](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/developer/specs/nodepool-in-zuul.html) implementation is well underway, and support for Ansible 11 is in the pipeline. Zuul operators should start thinking about dropping Ansible 8 support as Zuul will drop Ansible 8 when Ansible 11 is included.
