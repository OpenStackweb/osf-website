# OpenInfra Summit Sessions Available to Stream

The [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) united over 1,200 attendees from 65+ countries at École Polytechnique to celebrate global collaboration in open infrastructure. Opening the event, OpenInfra Foundation GM Thierry Carrez reminded participants that [true resilience lies not in technology but in community](https://youtu.be/XsUTVgDAUxA?si=0dK_GUOh9LneefZ5). Supported by sponsors including OVHcloud, Canonical, Huawei and Mirantis, the Summit highlighted the strength and innovation of the open source movement in the European region.

Throughout the week, keynotes and demos showcased open collaboration in action.
