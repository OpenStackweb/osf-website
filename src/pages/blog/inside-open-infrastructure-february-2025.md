**The OpenInfra Diversity & Inclusion Working Group**

The [OpenInfra Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Working Group](https://openinfra.org/about/diversity) was created to foster a welcoming environment within the global community by lowering barriers to entry and embracing diversity. Over the years, members of the OpenInfra Foundation Board of Directors, staff, and community members have collaborated to achieve this goal in various ways.

One of the key initiatives of the OpenInfra D&I Working Group has been conducting diversity surveys to identify challenges within OpenInfra project communities and work toward solutions. For example, survey results revealed that newcomers struggled with tools such as Git and Gerrit, which hindered their ability to contribute. In response, the group organized "Git and Gerrit Lunch and Learn" sessions at in-person events to help new contributors gain hands-on experience. The group has also facilitated mentoring programs, including initiatives during Open Source Days at the [Grace Hopper Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/ghc-25-announcement/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAlPu9BhAjEiwA5NDSA9uDKKDcmvD0qlb-32tjFboXEvMIaSQJq1I9CwRidx1trZUyVUn7nxoC0owQAvD_BwE) and within the OpenInfra community itself.

In addition to education and mentorship, the working group has led efforts to promote inclusive language in OpenInfra projects and communications ([read more here](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/Inclusive_Language)). As community needs evolve, the group has also played a key role in updating the [OpenInfra Community Code of Conduct](https://openinfra.org/legal/code-of-conduct) to ensure that OpenInfra activities remain safe and inclusive.

Looking ahead to 2025, the group aims to support the community in implementing and promoting translation efforts and improving the diversity landing page to provide clearer and more accessible information.

# OpenInfra Foundation News

* OpenInfra Members continue to build on the success of the [VMware Migration Working Group](https://www.openstack.org/vmware-migration-to-openstack). We held our first meeting on Feb 11 and are continuing to meet bi-weekly to develop an even more ambitious publication for 2025. The upcoming VMware Migration Guide will continue to educate the market on the power of open source virtualization as an alternative to single-vendor solutions.
* The OpenInfra for AI Working Group met for the first time this month in an effort to gather OpenInfra Members to tell the stories of AI workloads running on OpenStack-powered infrastructure. We’ll be working over the coming months to publish these architectures to the broader community and ecosystem.
