**2024 — A Year in Review**

As mentioned in [Jonathan Bryce's blog post ](https://openinfra.dev/blog/2024-openinfra-foundation-annual-report)and introduction to the 2024 OpenInfra Foundation Annual Report, 2024 was a good year for OpenInfra. Partnered with a surge in open source momentum, the global community rallied around three OpenInfra goals to advance development and adoption of open infrastructure: 

* Protect the OpenInfra Vision of Open Source
* Support and Strengthen OpenInfra Projects 
* Increase OpenInfra Impact 

The 2024 OpenInfra Foundation Annual Report provides highlights from not only the milestones achieved by the community but also how we responded to the drivers behind open source momentum include AI redefining infrastructure, as well as concerns around digital sovereignty, licensing changes, or security.
