**2024 — A Very Good Year for OpenInfra**

***Jonathan Bryce, Executive Director, OpenInfra Foundation***

In retrospect, 2024 turned out to be a much more exciting year for Open Infrastructure than I anticipated. At the OpenInfra Foundation, we made tremendous progress toward our 2024 goals of protecting the OpenInfra vision of open source, supporting and strengthening our projects, and increasing OpenInfra’s impact. This progress is well documented in the following report, but let me call out a few reasons why I am particularly energized by how the OpenInfra community progressed this year.

* First, we’re seeing a resurgence of support and adoption among organizations and individuals who wholeheartedly embrace the freedom and innovation that only open source collaboration provides. 
* Second, the OpenInfra community is stepping up to meet the moment on regional challenges and opportunities.
* Third, the OpenInfra community is having a very tangible impact on shaping the future.

It’s been a truly great year! And together we can make 2025 even better as we work together to deliver the OpenInfra software that drives the global economy and human progress.
