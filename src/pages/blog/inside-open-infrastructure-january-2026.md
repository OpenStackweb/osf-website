# OpenInfra for Digital Sovereignty

OpenInfra projects like OpenStack and Kata Containers are freely available and community-driven, enabling nations to create local infrastructure without vendor lock-in or external dependencies. This model builds trust and increases resilience to  geopolitical or commercial environment changes. It also allows for more controlled ownership over one’s data, including the storage and usage of it. 

In January, the OpenInfra community kicked off a collaborative effort to elevate OpenInfra projects’ role in enabling digital sovereignty. Participants represented several regions where this trend is putting pressure on infrastructure to adapt to regional or local regulations and needs. The group will finalize goals for the effort and regularly meet to develop case studies and documentation to improve awareness for OpenInfra and how it provides governments and enterprises the tools to build local, trusted systems without sacrificing global collaboration. If you're interested in participating in the Digital Sovereignty Working Group, add your name and contact information [to the etherpad](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/Digital-Sovereignty-WG).
