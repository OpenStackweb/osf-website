# OpenInfra Summit Schedule: For the Community, by the Community 

The [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) is a **community-driven event**, made possible by the dedication and passion of volunteers from across the globe. This year, **over 30 volunteers** came together to shape every element of the OpenInfra Summit experience, from reviewing talks and building the schedule to creating speaker graphics, developing local tourism resources, and launching new community-focused initiatives like the [New Contributor Showcase](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/new-contributors-at-the-openInfra-summit).

Today, we are highlighting the [OpenInfra Summit Programming Committee](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/who-we-are/). These contributors have spent countless hours curating the content that will be presented on stage, ensuring the agenda reflects the innovation, collaboration, and diversity of the global OpenInfra ecosystem. Their work has culminated in the official release of the [OpenInfra Summit schedule](http://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule), **now live and featuring dozens of sessions** that highlight the most exciting developments across open source infrastructure.

We’d like to specifically recognize **Amy Marrich, who led the CFP review and schedule build process** with thoughtfulness and precision. Her leadership helped guide the programming team through hundreds of submissions, resulting in a well-balanced and dynamic lineup of sessions that showcase the depth and breadth of the OpenInfra community.

From behind-the-scenes logistics to creative contributions, **the work of these volunteers is what brings the OpenInfra Summit to life**. We are incredibly grateful for their time, energy, and commitment to making the OpenInfra Summit Europe a world-class event.

# OpenInfra Foundation News

* The [OpenInfra Foundation has officially joined the Linux Foundation](https://openinfra.org/blog/openinfra-joins-linux-foundation), creating unprecedented alignment in open source infrastructure! For the first time, open source standards for operating systems (Linux), cloud infrastructure (OpenStack), and containers (Kubernetes) are all under the same collaborative umbrella. This move combines resources while preserving OpenInfra's community-driven approach, positioning us to accelerate innovation in AI-ready infrastructure and cross-project collaboration.
* The Linux Foundation has appointed [Jonathan Bryce as Executive Director, Cloud & Infrastructure and Chris Aniszczyk as CTO, Cloud & Infrastructure](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-appoints-jonathan-bryce-as-executive-director-cloud-infrastructure-and-chris-aniszczyk-as-cto-cloud-infrastructure-to-oversee-major-open-s-1750718282015), to oversee major open source initiatives including OpenInfra and CNCF. Jonathan will serve as executive director of both CNCF and the OpenInfra Foundation, establishing a stronger collaborative bond across the two foundations and driving strategic alignment throughout the broader open source ecosystem.
* The OpenInfra Member VMware Migration Working Group published a comprehensive VMware to OpenStack Migration Guide this month, [The Future of Virtualization: Modernizing Your Data Center with OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/vmware-migration-to-openstack/)
