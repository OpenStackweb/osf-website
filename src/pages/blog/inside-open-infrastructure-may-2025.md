# Bridging the Gap

Open source foundations play an important role in the ecosystem through crucial services, like trademark management, marketing and events they provide to the communities they support. Community management is another critical function, which often doesn't get as much visibility as it deserves.

Community management ensures that communities function efficiently, remain sustainable over time and are accessible to anyone who decides to invest their time and resources into the project. Getting involved in open source projects can be challenging, especially in case of large, more complex ones like OpenStack. OpenInfra community managers have been working with the community, including active contributors, maintainers and users to better understand their experience and identify challenges and bottlenecks to improve. This effort is called ‘Bridging the Gap,' and it targets to further improve the OpenStack community’s accessibility to individuals and organizations who are looking into getting more deeply involved, but need help to take next steps towards more substantial contributions. At the same time, this effort is also set out to improve the maintainer experience within the project, to increase bandwidth and avoid burnout.

If you are an active contributor or maintainer to the project, make sure to fill out the [OpenStack surveys](https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/message/3RZVTYLY5KIBLXG4DRBDUM7RF34HDXNU/) that were distributed when the OpenStack Epoxy release came out, and provide feedback about your experience during that most recent release cycle. Your insights will help OpenInfra community managers to provide better support and more informed guidance to contributors on how to improve processes, workflows and documentation and improve the contributor experience for new and established contributors alike.

# OpenStack: Open source software for creating private and public clouds

* OpenStack is preparing to replace its use of the OpenInfra Individual Contributor License Agreement with the more standard Developer Certificate of Origin starting on July 1, 2025. Contributors are encouraged to start adding “Signed-Off-By” footers to their commit messages before that date in preparation (typically with git commit’s “-s” command-line option or by setting equivalent persistent configuration). See [the proposed Technical Committee resolution](https://review.opendev.org/950463) for details.
