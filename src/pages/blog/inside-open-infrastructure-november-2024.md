The OpenInfra Member: VMware Migration Working Group was formed earlier this year to help educate and inform organizations looking to move their workloads from VMware to OpenStack. As part of this effort, OpenInfra Foundation commissioned a white paper from IT reporter [Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjvn1/), [Migrating from VMware to OpenStack: Optimizing your Infrastructure to Save Money and Avoid Vendor-Lock-in](https://www.openstack.org/vmware-migration-to-openstack-white-paper).
