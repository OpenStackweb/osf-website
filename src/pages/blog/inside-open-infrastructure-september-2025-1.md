# OpenInfra Summit Sessions Available to Stream

The [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) united over 1,200 attendees from 65+ countries at École Polytechnique to celebrate global collaboration in open infrastructure. Opening the event, OpenInfra Foundation GM Thierry Carrez reminded participants that [true resilience lies not in technology but in community](https://youtu.be/XsUTVgDAUxA?si=0dK_GUOh9LneefZ5). Supported by sponsors including OVHcloud, Canonical, Huawei and Mirantis, the Summit highlighted the strength and innovation of the open source movement in the European region.

Throughout the week, keynotes and demos showcased open collaboration in action.

* OpenInfra members executed [simultaneous workload migrations from VMware to OpenStack](https://youtu.be/slOxTkVEiSE?si=B4Gr4JC9bDkJmMgc)
* [NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/bdoF5hQojaA?si=ChvWyFu6ArSk_X6c) and [Ant Open Source](https://youtu.be/QxUJjg04ipc?si=FB2nFUAphTY7DuiH) demonstrated Kata Containers’ role in securing AI workloads
* A new [OpenStack for AI white paper](https://www.openstack.org/openstack-for-ai/) was announced, detailing production-ready architectures 
* [OVHcloud founder Octave Klaba](https://youtu.be/n3SKNXH3hTI?si=HOpTMnif3ySTyDiF) shared how open infrastructure supports resilience and innovation
* [ECMWF](https://youtu.be/ban-qA-F814?si=5_lf8Bry-ehLOZyr) and [BT Group](https://youtu.be/RPNsT5W1zfY?si=9B0WrD4o1yjLU_om) detailed their architectures for weather forecasting and UK telco infrastructure respectively, both leveraging the OpenInfra Blueprint (the open source standard combining Linux, OpenStack, and Kubernetes) 
* The Summit also honored top contributors and [named StackHPC as the newest Superuser Award winner](https://youtu.be/9ITY0tF3cpA?si=9j3Cjtpzph1Q_wg0).
