# The OpenInfra University Partnership Program

The [University Partnership Program (UPP)](https://openinfra.org/university-partnership-program/) is a targeted effort to encourage collaboration between the OpenInfra Foundation and universities and colleges all around the globe to get more students involved in open source and build up the pipeline of young professionals in open source.

* A recent graduate from Oregon State University and a former intern in the Open Source Lab, Antonia Gaete has been hired by the Linux Foundation and now works as a Cloud Operations Engineer there. She [shared her experiences in a Superuser article](https://superuser.openinfra.org/articles/from-student-to-engineer-antonia-gaete/) discussing her path from an intern to an open source contributor and onto an engineer.
* This year, OpenStack is again on the short list of open source projects for students taking Professor Braught’s course series at Dickinson College as a vetted project where students can have an impact. Last year, students engaged with the Swift community to contribute for two back to back semesters and [shared some of that experience with our community](https://www.openstack.org/blog/students-of-openstack-meet-boosung-kim/).

At the OpenInfra Summit Europe, we’ve put together a ton of [student-friendly sessions and hands-on workshops which you can find here](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/new-contributors-at-the-openinfra-summit/). We are also happy to extend discounted registration to not just students, but also professors and university researchers, just email us at [summit@openinfra.org](mailto:summit@openinfra.org) and we’ll get you set up.

Some Highlights on the schedule include:

* How to Do Code Review Like a Pro
* From Zero to Code: How to Get Started in OpenStack
* Hands-On: Infrastructure Provision with Terraform or OpenTOFU
* How Can You Contribute to OpenStack?
* A Universe from Nothing: Hands-on Introduction to OpenStack

This event is truly a great chance for students to meet open source developers from around the world, pick up real-world skills, and even start contributing to major projects like OpenStack. Our OpenInfra projects welcome new contributors and are excited about the next generation of open source contributor!

# OpenStack: Open source software for creating private and public clouds

* Running OpenStack? This is your annual chance to share feedback and architectural choices via the [OpenStack User Survey](http://openstack.org/usersurvey) to support the upstream community. The deadline to participate in this year’s analysis is Friday, August 29.
* Operators deploying the Watcher service will want to read [OSSN-0094](https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-announce@lists.openstack.org/thread/Y45GZNCXK6FM4ZRYIM767FRNXEBEEMI6/), making sure to apply the relevant bug fixes and follow its other recommended actions, including looking for any indication of prior volume collisions.
* Are you running artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads on OpenStack, or want to share how you fine-tune your deployment to support them? Get involved with the OpenInfra AI Working Group and [help draft the upcoming OpenStack for AI White Paper](https://lists.openstack.org/archives/list/openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org/thread/QGADCGXW2J5PJZKDH24VMJJJOM72GQTF/#QGADCGXW2J5PJZKDH24VMJJJOM72GQTF)!

# OpenDev: Free software needs free tools

* OpenDev’s Zuul installation now defaults to running jobs with Ansible 11 in all tenants. Ansible 11 does not work with Python older than version 3.8. One consequence of this is that jobs running on Ubuntu Bionic will no longer function. When Zuul drops support for Ansible 9 entirely, OpenDev will drop its Ubuntu Bionic test nodes completely.
