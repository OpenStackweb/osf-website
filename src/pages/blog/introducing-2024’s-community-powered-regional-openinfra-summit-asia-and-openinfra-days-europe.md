## The Community-Powered, Regional OpenInfra Summit Asia 2024

For the past decade, the OpenInfra Summit, formerly known as the OpenStack Summit, has provided a centralized opportunity for the global community to collaborate. To build the next decade of open infrastructure, Regional OpenInfra Summits will be developed by the community for the community. Community volunteers will provide an opportunity to collaborate directly with the people building and running open source infrastructure using Linux, OpenStack, Kubernetes and 30+ other technologies. Attendees typically represent 60 countries and hundreds of organizations and participate in keynote presentations from industry leaders, breakout presentations, Forum discussions with operators and developers, and a busy hallway track of open source enthusiasts.

The Community-Powered Openinfra Summit will be piloted in 2024 by the Korean community organizers in collaboration with fellow organizers from various regions of Asia.
