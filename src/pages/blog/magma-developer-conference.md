One week from today on February 3, the Magma community will be hosting the Magma Developers Conference. This virtual conference will be an opportunity to hear from Magma developers as they share more about the growing Magma community and how the platform enables service providers and systems integrators to deploy faster and more efficient networks. The schedule includes Magma use cases, a 5G demo, and other talks about the state of the project.  I am excited to be emceeing this conference with Phil Ritter, an active member of the Magma project. Personally, I am the most excited for the 5G FWA demo. It’s a use case that cloud native architecture is ideally suited for, with local break out. The demo will take place at 11:15am PST so make sure to [register for free now](https://magmadevelopersconference.splashthat.com/) so you don’t miss it.

Magma is an open-source software platform that delivers an open, flexible and extendable mobile network core solution. Magma’s mission is to connect the world to a faster network by enabling service providers to build cost-effective and extensible carrier-grade networks.  It is designed to be access network agnostic (4G, 5G or WiFi), flexibly supporting a radio access network with minimal development and deployment effort.

At the [Open Infrastructure Summit in October 2020, the Open Infrastructure Foundation announced its support of the Magma project](https://youtu.be/wNNOFfDBB0o). With help from the Foundation, the [Magma project website](http://magmacore.org) has been structured to make it easy to contribute to the project. It is centered around a developer-led governance with Maintainers providing code review and approval for contributions and a small Technical Committee selected from among the project maintainers providing overall architecture and roadmap oversight.
