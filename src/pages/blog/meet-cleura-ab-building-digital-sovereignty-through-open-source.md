For [Cleura](https://cleura.com/), open infrastructure is more than just a technological choice, it’s a cultural commitment. Our mission is to help shape the future of European digital sovereignty on the foundations of transparency, independence, and trust.

Becoming an OpenInfra Member wasn’t just a decision, it was a natural alignment with our core beliefs. The world needs open source, and OpenInfra in particular, to ensure lasting control over data, infrastructure, and digital destiny. At Cleura, we fully embrace and nurture the expertise required to bring these benefits to market, ensuring that sovereignty and open innovation go hand in hand.

### Our Core Focus: OpenStack and Zuul

* [OpenStack](https://openstack.org) is the backbone of Cleura’s IaaS platform, powering compute, storage, networking, and identity services across multiple regions. We deploy via OpenStack-Ansible and are now rolling out a three-availability-zone design to further strengthen resilience. Our strategy emphasizes GDPR compliance, data sovereignty, and an open-source-first approach.
* [Zuul](https://zuulci.org) powers our CI/CD pipeline, orchestrating automation for internal R&D, reproducible testing, release gating, and ensuring that our contributions are always upstream-ready.

Together, these platforms form the foundation of a resilient, sovereign cloud aligned with European needs.

### Innovation and Engagement

Cleura continues to innovate, through ongoing or planned upstream contributions to several Openstack projects. Read more in our [declaration of intent](https://cleura.com/news/cleura-doubles-down-on-open-source-cloud-innovation/) regarding R&D.

Additionally, as a Gold Member of the OpenInfra Foundation, Cleura is actively engaged in the community through upstream contributions to OpenStack projects like Trove and Freezer, participation in events such as [OpenInfra Summit Europe 2025](https://openinfra.org/summit) and Ceph Days Berlin, and collaboration with other members to advance open-source cloud infrastructure. Our involvement ensures our cloud services follow community best practices while supporting knowledge sharing, innovation, and the growth of the OpenInfra ecosystem.
