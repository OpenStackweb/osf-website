At Cloud&Heat, our commitment to open source technologies goes far beyond just using software, it's a core part of how we innovate, build, and collaborate. That’s why becoming a Silver Member of the OpenInfra Foundation was a natural step for us. It aligns with our mission to drive forward digitally sovereign, sustainable, and secure cloud infrastructure and to do it together with a global community.

### Supporting the OpenInfra Mission

Our OpenInfra membership is part of our broader strategy to engage meaningfully with the open source ecosystem. We’ve long been committed users and contributors to OpenStack, which powers many of our products and services. Through this membership, we aim to:

* Stay up to date with community and project developments
* Collaborate with like-minded organizations
* Support the broader mission of openness and innovation
* Gain visibility for our work and contributions

### Our Work with OpenInfra Projects

Our primary focus within the OpenInfra ecosystem is OpenStack. It forms the backbone of our:

* [Cloud services](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/products/cloud-services/), which deliver scalable, efficient, and secure infrastructure powered by open source technologies
* [On-premises cloud infrastructure](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/products/on-premises-cloud-infrastrukturen/), which we offer as turnkey standard solutions, with a strong focus on data sovereignty and energy efficiency or as tailored products to meet specific customer needs

We don’t just deploy OpenStack, we also actively support its development and contribute to the community. We have also initiated and developed open source projects that enhance and complement OpenStack. For instance, we were one of the initiators of [Yaook](https://yaook.cloud/en/), an open source lifecycle management tool for OpenStack, and are still one of its key contributors.

### Upcoming Events & Community Engagement

We’re proud to be a sponsor of the [OpenInfra Summit Europe 2025](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/), where we’ll connect with industry leaders, developers, and partners to shape the future of open infrastructure.

We’re also excited to sponsor and be part of the [ALASCA Summit 2025](https://alasca.cloud/alasca-summit-2025/), taking place on November 3–4 in Dresden, Germany. This event will bring together experts and practitioners to explore the latest in cloud and open source innovation.

### Real-World Impact: OpenInfra in Action

Our infrastructure and expertise help power a wide range of customers and use cases — many of which rely on OpenStack. For instance, we supported the German cloud provider [STACKIT](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/reference/stackit/) with the development of a public cloud offering built on OpenStack. We also worked with them to develop the OpenStack lifecycle management tool Yaook. In addition, we have delivered Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) based on OpenStack to a range of companies developing and deploying applications on our platform. Companies with innovative AI use cases like [elevait](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/reference/elevait/), [Nyris](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/reference/nyris/), [Scalytics](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/reference/scalytics/) or [tracetronic](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/reference/tracetronic/) have trusted our infrastructure to power their products. 

Furthermore, we have delivered on-premises cloud infrastructures, where OpenStack is a key building block, to a range of organizations that value digital sovereignty, data security and transparency. And this is just the beginning! We have more deployments coming soon. You can read more about our customers and use cases [here](https://www.cloudandheat.com/en/references/). 

At Cloud&Heat, we believe the future of digital infrastructure is open, collaborative, and sustainable. Our work with the OpenInfra Foundation and OpenStack is helping to make that vision a reality, and we’re just getting started.
