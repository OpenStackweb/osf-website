At [Cloudification](https://cloudification.io/), we believe that open infrastructure is the key to building a truly sovereign, scalable, and future-ready cloud. 

That’s why we’re proud to be a member of the OpenInfra Foundation, a global community of technologists and organizations committed to developing and promoting open source infrastructure solutions. Our membership reflects our dedication to supporting and growing the OpenInfra ecosystem and contributing back to the community through knowledge sharing, technical expertise, and numerous code contributions.

### Powering Sovereign Cloud with OpenStack & Kubernetes

At the heart of our cloud platform, [c12n.cloud](https://cloudification.io/c12n-private-cloud/), is OpenStack, which provides full compute, networking, and storage capabilities that form the crucial foundation of the environments we deliver to our customers. Whether it’s a migration from VMware or the deployment of a GPU-powered AI cloud, OpenStack enables our clients to gain agility, scalability, and control without being tied to proprietary platforms.

But we don’t stop at IaaS. We combine OpenStack with Kubernetes to build a truly modern and manageable cloud. Kubernetes not only powers container workloads for our users, it also orchestrates OpenStack itself. This integration simplifies Day 2 operations, brings GitOps into infrastructure management, and makes lifecycle management of the cloud platform seamless and automated.

This combination allows us to offer a powerful alternative to public clouds and traditional virtualization stacks, one that’s open, flexible, and tailored for operational efficiency at scale.

### Contributing to the OpenInfra Ecosystem

Our engagement with the OpenInfra community goes beyond using the technology. We actively contribute to several OpenInfra projects, including:

* OpenStack with contributions to Manila, Nova, Designate, Octavia, and others
* Kubernetes as part of our orchestration layer
* Gardener, which we’ve successfully integrated to replace Magnum in certain use cases

Our engineers have submitted over 100 upstream changes in recent years, strengthening the ecosystem and helping solve real-world challenges that benefit the wider community.

Cloudification has also been recognized in an OpenInfra Foundation white paper as a trusted, vendor-neutral alternative to VMware. Our detailed VMware vs. OpenStack comparison table was highlighted as a valuable resource for organizations considering their cloud transformation options.

### Join Us at OpenInfra Summit Europe 2025

We’re excited to announce that Cloudification will be at [OpenInfra Summit Europe 2025](http://summit2025.openinfra.org/), where we’ll be sharing our latest insights and technical expertise through two deep-dive talks:

* [Lessons Learned from Replacing Magnum with Gardener on OpenStack](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule/#view=calendar&title=Gardener) by Dmitry Galkin & Maksim Shepelev
* [OVN Traffic Flow & Troubleshooting](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule/#view=calendar&title=OVN%20Traffic%20Flow%20%26%20Troubleshooting) by Vadim Ponomarev

If you’re attending, come find us! We’d love to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate on building the next generation of open infrastructure.
