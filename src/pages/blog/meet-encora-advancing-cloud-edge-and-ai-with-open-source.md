At [Encora](https://www.encora.com/), our mission is to empower organizations with cutting-edge digital engineering solutions that are open, scalable, and future-ready. That’s why we’re proud to be a member of the OpenInfra Foundation — a global community committed to advancing open-source infrastructure technologies.

As an OpenInfra Foundation member, we align with the mission to drive open innovation in infrastructure technologies. Being part of this collaborative, global ecosystem allows us to:

* Contribute directly to foundational open source projects.
* Engage with a vibrant network of technologists, practitioners, and thought leaders.
* Stay at the forefront of cloud, edge, and container infrastructure innovation.

This commitment to openness and interoperability helps us deliver stronger, more sustainable outcomes for our clients and partners.

### Encora’s Work Across OpenInfra Projects

Encora’s teams actively engage with several OpenInfra projects, bringing deep technical expertise and real-world implementation experience:

* [OpenStack](openstack.org): We architect, deploy, and optimize OpenStack-powered private and hybrid clouds for clients across industries, enabling agility, cost efficiency, and scalability 
* [Zuul](zuulci.org): We leverage Zuul’s CI/CD capabilities to streamline software delivery pipelines for our clients and internally, ensuring fast, automated, and reliable deployments 
* [StarlingX](starlingx.io): Our involvement with StarlingX is both directly and via our partners. Together, we build products for edge computing use cases particularly in telecom scenarios

Beyond implementation, we also contribute back to the OpenInfra community through documentation improvements, code contributions, and active participation in project discussions.

## Innovating Across Industries

Encora is a digital engineering specialist headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. We bring a data-first, cloud-smart, and AI-enabled approach to engineering, helping clients modernize core value streams in hyper-connected industries.

Our accelerators and specialized offerings support global clients in telecom, automotive, media, and energy sectors, driving innovation across connectivity, mobility, content, and utilities.

Here are just a few of our solutions in action:

* [Operations Assistant for Telecom](https://www.encora.com/accelerators/operations-assistant-for-telecom)
* [Anomaly Detection for Telecom](https://www.encora.com/accelerators/anomaly-detection-for-telecom)
* [Connected Test Platform for Automotive](https://www.encora.com/accelerators/encora-connected-test-platform-for-automotive-enctp)
* [Media Asset Management](https://www.encora.com/accelerators/emama)
* [Media Integration for Avid ](https://www.encora.com/accelerators/encora-media-integration-for-avid-enmi)

### Making OpenInfra More Accessible

One of the key challenges in the open-source world is adoption, and we’re proud to help lower the barriers. For example, StarlingX previously required a complex setup, which made experimentation difficult. Encora helped simplify this by enabling StarlingX to run on a laptop, making it accessible for anyone looking to learn or prototype on the platform.

We also contribute by rewriting README files for clarity, fixing bugs, and enhancing documentation to improve project stability and user experience.

As we continue to collaborate with the OpenInfra Foundation and its members, our focus remains on building reliable, scalable, and innovative infrastructure solutions that support real-world business needs. We’re excited about what the future holds and proud to play a role in shaping the open source infrastructure ecosystem.
