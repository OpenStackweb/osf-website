At Fairbanks, we became an OpenInfra Silver Member because we believe open source is the foundation for true digital autonomy. Organizations today need more than scalable infrastructure. They need to stay in control of their data, their technology choices, and their operations. By collaborating with the OpenInfra community, we help make this possible.

Our team has years of experience building and operating production clouds based on OpenStack and Ceph. These projects give enterprises and public institutions the flexibility to run workloads in their own private environments, without being locked into a single vendor or region.

Through our sovereign private cloud solution, we provide organizations with an infrastructure that is open, compliant, and designed for long term independence. We help them achieve full digital sovereignty by addressing all its dimensions: control over data, operations, and technology choices, often referred to as data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, and technological sovereignty. Whether it is in healthcare, finance, or government, sovereignty is becoming a key requirement, and open source is the best way to achieve it.

 In practice, this means helping customers design, build, and operate clouds that are tailored to their specific needs while remaining fully transparent and secure. By working closely with the OpenInfra community, we also contribute insights from real world use cases and ensure that our customers benefit from the rapid innovation happening across open infrastructure projects.

We are proud to support the OpenInfra Foundation and its mission, and we look forward to continuing to contribute to the growth and adoption of open infrastructure worldwide.
