[FPT Smart Cloud](https://fptsmartcloud.com/en/home/) (FCI), a member of FPT Corporation, Vietnam’s leading provider of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing solutions, was founded with the mission of building a world-class AI application platform and cloud services ecosystem that drives breakthrough innovation in business operations.

By joining the OpenInfra Foundation, we affirm our pioneering role: not only spreading the value of open source but also contributing directly with modern infrastructure, practical experience, and a high-quality engineering team. Membership allows us to accelerate the growth of the open source ecosystem in Vietnam while connecting with a global community that shares our vision.

### Our Core Focus: OpenStack-Powered Cloud at Scale

FPT Smart Cloud has relied on OpenStack since 2020 to power FPT Cloud, one of the largest and fastest-growing cloud platforms in Vietnam. Today, our OpenStack-based infrastructure spans multi-region deployments across Vietnam and Japan, scaling to more than 1,000 hypervisors.

On top of this foundation, we deliver Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and AI SaaS offerings that empower businesses with scalable, intelligent cloud solutions.

And we’re just getting started: in 2025, we will launch two AI Factories in Vietnam and Japan, designed to accelerate the AI revolution in Asia. These facilities will leverage up to 2,000 NVIDIA H100/H200 GPUs, all orchestrated by our high-performance, customized OpenStack platform.

### Innovative Products

* [FPT AI Factory](https://ai.fptcloud.com/): The OpenStack and NVIDIA-powered AI factory that started in Vietnam and expanded to Japan in November 2024. Within these AI factories, OpenStack is being used to manage 1,000 H100 GPUs in Vietnam and 1,000 H200 GPUs in Japan.
* [FPT AI](https://fpt.ai): comprehensive AI Platform for business 

### Continuing Commitment to Open Source

We are committed to continuing close collaboration with the OpenInfra community, strengthening partnerships, and increasing FPT’s contributions at the global level.
