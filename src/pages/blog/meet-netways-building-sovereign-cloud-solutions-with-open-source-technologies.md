[](https://nws.netways.de/en/managed-services/)[NETWAYS Managed Services](https://nws.netways.de/en/managed-services/) thrives on open source. With OpenStack at the heart of our cloud platform, becoming an OpenInfra Member was a natural step. We’re committed to giving back to the upstream community that makes our work possible by contributing code, sharing knowledge, and participating in the global exchange of ideas that OpenInfra enables.

### How We Use OpenInfra Projects

OpenStack is not just a component of our tech stack,  it's the foundation. Our flagship offerings like the NETWAYS Cloud, NETWAYS Managed Kubernetes®, and various SaaS applications are all powered by OpenStack.

Thanks to OpenStack’s mature, actively maintained platform, we're able to deliver:

* High-quality services
* Simplified maintenance processes
* Rapid, reliable innovation

Without it, scaling and sustaining the level of service our customers expect would be significantly more challenging.

### What Makes the NETWAYS Cloud Unique?

We’ve built the NETWAYS Cloud to reflect what a modern public cloud should offer — especially for businesses focused on data sovereignty, vendor neutrality, and operational flexibility:

* Open Standards & APIs: Powered by OpenStack, our platform ensures freedom from vendor lock-in.
* Two Availability Zones: Spanning multiple data centers and powered by our own hardware for enhanced reliability.
* Compliance: Our infrastructure meets critical standards like ISO27001 and PCI DSS, essential for our customers in the EU and beyond.

### Committed to the OpenInfra Community

We’re not just users, we’re active participants in the OpenInfra ecosystem. Over the years, NETWAYS has:

* Sponsored official OpenInfra events
* Presented at global conferences
* Hosted our own event, stackconf, to foster dialogue around sovereign, open-source cloud platforms

Community is at the heart of everything we do. Whether it’s contributing upstream, organizing events, or simply sharing knowledge, NETWAYS is here to help advance the open source movement.
