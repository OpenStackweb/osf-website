[PlanetHoster](https://www.planethoster.com/en) is a fast-growing managed hosting provider built on open source technologies at the core of its business. For more than a decade, we’ve relied on platforms like OpenStack to deliver the flexibility, scalability, and reliability our customers expect.

Becoming an OpenInfra Member is our way of giving back to the global community that builds and sustains the technologies we use every day. By supporting the OpenInfra Foundation, we aim to help make platforms like OpenStack even more popular and widely adopted, increase the number of contributors, and ensure that it remains a stable and future-proof solution for years to come.

### Our Core Focus: OpenStack at the Heart of Hosting

OpenStack is the foundation of our hosting business. When we adopted it nearly 10 years ago, it allowed us to move beyond the constraints of bare-metal hosting and gave us new tools to grow and improve. With OpenStack we achieved:

* Automation
* Efficient hardware resource management
* High uptime and reliability

Today, more than 95% of our hosting business runs on several OpenStack clouds, and we remain fully committed to building on this proven platform.

### Innovation and Engagement

One of our flagship offerings is the [HybridCloud N0C](https://blog.planethoster.com/en/planethoster-unveils-hybridcloud-n0c-a-next-generation-dedicated-server-offering/), a hosting solution powered by our internally developed control panel system. Running entirely in OpenStack virtual machines, HybridCloud N0C gives our customers the flexibility to deploy across multiple locations: Montreal (Canada), Paris (France), and Lausanne (Switzerland).

We’re also preparing to expand into private cloud deployment and hosting services. Customers will soon be able to provision secure, managed N0C VM images, complete with full support: a PaaS-like experience that simplifies cloud adoption while maintaining reliability.

### Commitment to Upstream Development

Our focus on innovation has always been paired with a respect for the open source communities that make it possible. PlanetHoster is committed to contributing back to the ecosystem, ensuring that platforms like OpenStack remain stable, innovative, and ready for the next decade of cloud adoption.

### Looking Ahead

As a long-time OpenStack user, PlanetHoster is proud to be part of the OpenInfra community. With continued investment in open source, a growing portfolio of cloud services, and an unwavering focus on digital sovereignty and scalability, we look forward to helping shape the next chapter of open infrastructure worldwide.
