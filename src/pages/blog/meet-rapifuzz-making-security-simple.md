[Rapifuzz Pvt. Ltd.](https://rapifuzz.in/) joined the OpenInfra Foundation to connect with a global community that is shaping the next generation of open-source infrastructure. OpenStack has been pivotal in this journey by helping us move beyond third-party cloud providers, take full control of our infrastructure, and optimize costs while boosting agility.

As members of OpenInfra, we aim to stay closely aligned with the latest developments in OpenStack and related projects, collaborate with like-minded organizations, and share lessons learned from our real-world deployments. This membership also opens the door to adopting emerging OpenInfra technologies, ensuring our infrastructure remains innovative, scalable, and ready for the future.

At the heart of RAPIFUZZ is a simple mission: Make Security Simple. We actively support and integrate with open-source ecosystems like OpenStack to ensure our cybersecurity solutions are agile, scalable, and transparent. 

### Our Core Focus

OpenStack serves as the backbone of our infrastructure, powering everything from our DevSecOps pipelines to production servers and cyber range environments. By running OpenStack in our own local data centers, we’ve achieved not just operational independence, but also greater cost efficiency and resilience.

We remain actively engaged with the OpenInfra community and are exploring opportunities to integrate our platforms more deeply with other OpenInfra projects.

### Innovation and Engagement

At RAPIFUZZ, innovation drives everything we do. We are proud to highlight three flagship solutions that embody our mission to simplify and strengthen security:

* APIFuzzer: A cutting-edge mutation-fuzzing solution that automates API security testing. APIFuzzer identifies unknown vulnerabilities in both standalone APIs and APIs embedded within applications. With actionable remediation guidance and lifecycle management, it empowers organizations to continuously strengthen their API security posture.
* CyberKshetra: An advanced cyber range platform that provides a safe yet realistic environment for simulating cyber threat scenarios. CyberKshetra equips teams with hands-on training, helping organizations build resilience, improve response strategies, and develop confident cybersecurity professionals ready to face evolving threats.
* INTRACIS: A purpose-built solution for CERTs and CSIRTs, designed to streamline the entire incident lifecycle. INTRACIS addresses critical challenges such as fragmented reporting, manual investigations, and delayed responses. With tools for stakeholder management and simplified incident reporting, it enhances organizational response capabilities and elevates cybersecurity readiness.

Through these solutions, we are not only serving our customers but also creating opportunities to collaborate with the OpenInfra community on security-focused integrations and innovations.

### Commitment to Upstream Development

While our primary focus has been building security platforms, RAPIFUZZ is eager to expand our contributions upstream. We are committed to sharing our expertise in API security, incident response, and cyber resilience to strengthen the OpenInfra ecosystem and ensure security remains a cornerstone of open infrastructure.

### Looking Ahead

RAPIFUZZ is excited to continue our journey as part of the OpenInfra community. By combining our passion for open source with our dedication to cybersecurity innovation, we aim to help shape a future where infrastructure is not only open and scalable, but also secure and resilient.
