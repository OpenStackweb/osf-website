[Safespring](https://www.safespring.com/en/) is dedicated to delivering secure, sovereign, and open cloud infrastructure for the Nordic region. By becoming an OpenInfra Member, we strengthen our mission to build on open standards and avoid vendor lock-in, ensuring our customers can rely on transparent, community-driven technologies.

Membership not only gives us a voice in the global OpenInfra community, it allows us to collaborate directly with contributors worldwide and support the foundation that sustains large-scale open source projects like OpenStack.

### Our Core Focus: OpenStack at Scale

OpenStack forms the backbone of Safespring’s Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform. We operate and maintain OpenStack clusters for our customers, actively contributing patches upstream when we encounter issues or need enhancements.

Our stack incorporates Keystone for S3 authentication and Calico for full Layer 3 BGP networking, combining flexibility with performance. While OpenStack is our core focus, we closely follow the development of other OpenInfra projects to evaluate future adoption and expand our offerings.

### Innovation and Engagement

In late 2025, we’re excited to launch the Safespring Container Platform, a managed Kubernetes service built for scalability, security, and sovereignty.

Designed for SaaS providers, public sector institutions, and research organizations, the platform delivers EU-sovereign, GDPR-compliant environments for cloud-native applications. Key features include:

* Built on CNCF projects and powered by Safespring Compute
* Dynamic scalability, allowing teams to start small and grow into full clusters\
  High performance and low latency, optimized for demanding ML and AI workloads with GPU acceleration
* EU compliance and data sovereignty, tailored to sensitive or regulated workloads

The platform is currently in beta, giving early adopters the chance to test capabilities and shape the service before its general release.

### Commitment to Upstream Development

Safespring has long championed open source in critical infrastructure. Our team regularly shares insights from running OpenStack at scale, participates in community discussions, and collaborates with fellow operators to strengthen ecosystem stability and performance.

We actively attend and occasionally speak at OpenInfra events, bringing real-world operational knowledge back to the community.

### Looking Ahead

Safespring is proud to stand alongside the OpenInfra community in advancing secure, sovereign, and open infrastructure. With our commitment to upstream contributions, innovative services like the Safespring Container Platform, and a focus on digital sovereignty, we are helping to shape the future of open infrastructure in the Nordics and beyond.
