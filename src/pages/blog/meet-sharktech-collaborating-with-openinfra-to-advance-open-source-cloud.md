At [Sharktech](https://sharktech.net/), our mission has always been to empower businesses with robust, flexible, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure. That journey, spanning decades of innovation in hosting, DDoS protection, and cloud services, has been deeply rooted in open source technologies. 

We became an OpenInfra Member to give back to the open source community that helped shape our cloud offerings. Our involvement allows us to collaborate with peers who share our belief in community-driven innovation, contribute our deployment insights, and remain at the forefront of open infrastructure evolution.

Being part of the OpenInfra ecosystem means more than just using open source tools, it means helping to shape them. It gives us a platform to share our successes and challenges in building secure, high-performance cloud environments, all while staying aligned with OpenInfra’s mission to advance open, community-driven innovation.

### OpenStack at the Core of Sharktech’s Cloud

OpenStack is the foundation of both our public and private cloud services. We operate OpenStack clusters across data centers worldwide, offering highly available compute, storage, and networking for customers ranging from small businesses to large enterprises.

Our team is actively involved in testing new OpenStack releases and contributing feedback from real-world use cases. This not only improves the software but ensures our customers benefit from the latest innovations and stability improvements. We also heavily integrate OpenStack APIs into our solutions to maintain workload portability and avoid vendor lock-in, key advantages for businesses looking for scalable, future-proof infrastructure.

### Let’s Collaborate

At Sharktech, we believe the future of infrastructure is open. Through our partnership with the OpenInfra Foundation, ongoing contributions to OpenStack, and industry engagement at events like CloudFest, we’re not just building clouds, we’re building a stronger, more open digital future.
