At [StackHPC](https://www.stackhpc.com/), our journey has always been rooted in open source. Since day one we’ve believed in the power of collaboration, community, and shared innovation. Ten years on that belief is stronger than ever, and our membership in the OpenInfra Foundation has played a key role in our continued growth and impact.

#### Why We’re an OpenInfra Member

Becoming a member of the OpenInfra Foundation was a natural step for us. The Foundation doesn’t just host open source projects, it nurtures thriving communities around them. We’ve seen firsthand how that grassroots approach to collaboration accelerates progress, encourages shared learning, and builds better tools for everyone.

Frankly, we don’t think we’d be where we are today without the community OpenInfra has built. It’s that ethos of openness and mutual support that continues to align so closely with our values.

#### Zeroing in on OpenStack for Research, HPC, and AI

At StackHPC, our work is centred almost entirely around OpenStack, particularly how it can be applied to research computing, high-performance computing (HPC), and AI. This specialisation is the cornerstone of our business, helping academic and scientific communities deploy cutting-edge infrastructure with open source agility.

We’re also excited to be exploring greater use of Zuul within our internal development, packaging, and testing workflows. While it’s still early days, we see a lot of potential in aligning our internal processes with upstream tools, reducing friction and smoothing the path from local innovation to upstream contribution.

Additionally, we're working with clients in the trusted research domain where tools like Kata Containers offer enhanced isolation for secure processing of sensitive data, a critical requirement in today’s privacy-conscious research landscape.

#### Products That Empower Researchers

We’re proud to support two major open source projects that extend the value of OpenInfra for research computing:

1. [Azimuth Cloud Portal](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/azimuth)Azimuth is our platform-as-a-service solution designed specifically for scientists and research software engineers. It runs as a Kubernetes workload on OpenStack, allowing users to deploy and manage compute platforms and applications from a curated catalogue quickly and easily.
2. [Slurm Appliance](https://github.com/stackhpc/ansible-slurm-appliance)The Slurm Appliance is a production-ready, cloud-native solution for deploying and managing Slurm HPC clusters. Built using Terraform/OpenTofu, Ansible, and CI pipelines, it brings modern infrastructure-as-code practices to the world of scientific computing.

Both of these tools are open source, widely adopted, and actively supported by StackHPC.

#### Looking Ahead: Deeper Engagement, Broader Contribution

Our commitment to OpenInfra and the broader open source ecosystem is only growing. We encourage everyone at StackHPC to engage with and contribute to OpenStack and related communities, not just because it benefits us, but because we believe in giving back to the ecosystem that has enabled our success.

We’re excited about the future and look forward to continuing our journey with the OpenInfra community.
