Since 2019, [Storware](https://superuser.openinfra.org/articles/storware-an-openstack-case-study/) has been at the forefront of enhancing OpenStack environment protection through its native integration. Our long-standing commitment to open infrastructure, which began with a strong KVM foundation in 2016, has resulted in a powerful synergy between Storware Backup & Recovery and OpenStack, making data protection more seamless, scalable, and secure. 

While our focus remains on OpenStack, our participation in the broader OpenInfra ecosystem underscores our commitment to open standards and innovation. Open source is in our DNA, and we continue to collaborate and contribute in ways that enhance infrastructure resiliency, security, and efficiency.

### Agentless Backup for OpenStack: Simplified Operations, Reduced Costs

One of the most significant advantages of integrating Storware with OpenStack is the ability to perform agentless backups. In simple terms, this means there’s no need to install software agents on individual hosts or virtual machines. This dramatically reduces operational overhead and maintenance requirements, an important factor for any IT team looking to streamline infrastructure management.

By supporting OpenStack environments natively and working smoothly with KVM, Storware ensures that your critical cloud data remains secure with minimal effort and maximal efficiency.

### Harnessing the Power of Horizon: Seamless Management Through a Unified Dashboard

OpenStack users typically rely on Horizon, a dedicated web-based dashboard for managing private cloud environments. We take this one step further by integrating our Backup & Recovery solution directly into Horizon via a dedicated plugin. This integration allows users to manage backup, restore, and disaster recovery (DR) processes from the same interface they already use for cloud administration.

The benefits?

* Per-tenant backup management
* Backup scheduling and policy definition
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure delegation
* White-label capability for Managed Service Providers (MSPs)

For MSPs, this white-label capability is particularly valuable. It allows them to offer branded backup services without revealing underlying technologies, providing flexibility in service packaging and presentation.

### A Feature-Rich Solution Tailored to Modern Needs

Storware Backup and Recovery for OpenStack is designed with both enterprise environments and service providers in mind. It brings together advanced functionality with a user-friendly approach, ensuring that backup and DR are no longer complex tasks requiring deep technical knowledge.

#### Key Features Include:

* Instant Restore – Minimize downtime with fast recovery.
* Incremental Backup – Especially for Ceph-based environments, reducing backup time and storage needs.
* Custom Workflows via API – Tailor backup processes to your specific requirements.\
  Multi-Tenant Support – Perfect for MSPs or large organizations with multiple departments/projects.
* Multiple Backup Destinations – Including native integration with OpenStack Swift.
* Intuitive HTML5 Interface – Seamless user experience directly within Horizon.
* Advanced Security Options – Including Air-Gap Backup (IsoLayer), Immutable Backup Destinations, Retention Lock, RBAC, MFA via Keycloak, and more.

### V2V Migration Plugin

As organizations seek greater flexibility, cost efficiency, and open-source innovation, migrating from VMware to OpenStack is becoming a strategic priority. Virtual to virtual or V2V migration, available within Storware Backup and Recovery solution, involves transferring an operating system, applications, and data from one virtual platform to another. 

#### V2V migration allows you to:

* simplify the migration process: from OS installation to hardware configuration,
* ensure cross-platform compatibility,
* migrate hypervisor-specific functionalities,
* and, of course, cost benefits when moving VMs from proprietary platforms to an open source environment.

### Ready to Simplify OpenStack Data Protection?

Storware Backup & Recovery for OpenStack offers a complete, robust, and scalable solution for protecting critical cloud data. Whether you're an enterprise IT team managing an internal cloud or an MSP delivering cloud services to your customers, Storware ensures data availability, compliance, and peace of mind.
