At [Ultimum Technologies](https://www.ultimum.io/), we believe that the future of digital infrastructure lies in openness, collaboration, and shared innovation. That’s why we’re proud to be a Silver Member of the OpenInfra Foundation, formalizing our long-standing commitment to the open source community and reinforcing our role in shaping the next generation of cloud and infrastructure technologies.

For our customers and partners, this means we are better positioned to anticipate industry trends, contribute to standards that improve interoperability, and ensure that the infrastructure layer remains open and community-driven.

We are excited to deepen our involvement with the OpenInfra community. As a Silver Member, we look forward to actively contributing, learning, and collaborating with partners who share our commitment to open infrastructure principles.

### Our Focus: Building with OpenStack

Ultimum Technologies works exclusively with OpenStack, and we’ve honed deep expertise in deploying and managing enterprise-grade solutions based on this powerful open source cloud platform.

Our OpenStack services include:

* Tailored architecture design
* Software repository management 
* Seamless integration with customer network and storage infrastructure
* Full lifecycle management—from continuous upgrades and patching to configuration updates

We go beyond the basics by providing end-to-end operations support, including:

* Deployment administration
* Incident resolution
* Performance tuning
* Capacity planning

Every solution we deliver is built for scalability, resilience, and full freedom from vendor lock-in, core principles that we believe every enterprise infrastructure should embody.

### Managed OpenStack Services, 24/7

While we’re not a traditional product vendor, our managed OpenStack services are at the heart of our customer value proposition. These services are typically deployed on-premises, where we help clients maintain operational continuity through:

* 24/7 support availability
* Guaranteed response and resolution times for critical requests
* Customized solution design and support
* Ongoing software maintenance and custom patch management

What truly sets us apart is our dedication to open source contributions. Whenever possible, we upstream our commits back to the OpenStack community, helping reduce the long-term cost of custom deployments while contributing to the health and sustainability of the broader ecosystem.

Whether you're building a new private cloud environment or seeking expert help to manage your existing infrastructure, Ultimum Technologies is here to help you harness the power of OpenStack with the confidence and support you need.
