At VyOS Networks, our mission has always been about enabling organizations to build secure, reliable, and scalable networks that are free from proprietary constraints. That’s why becoming an OpenInfra Member was a natural fit for us.

We believe in the OpenInfra Foundation’s vision: to build an open-source, vendor-neutral infrastructure stack that empowers users, fosters innovation, and avoids vendor lock-in. This closely mirrors our own philosophy at VyOS Networks. We’re committed to open collaboration, interoperability, and providing powerful networking tools that anyone can use and trust without compromising on flexibility or freedom.

### Supporting OpenStack with VyOS

Our main contribution to the OpenInfra ecosystem is through OpenStack. VyOS officially supports deployment on OpenStack platforms, and we provide customized installation images tailored for this use case. This means organizations running OpenStack can easily integrate VyOS as their core routing and firewall solution, with the assurance of full compatibility and enterprise-level support.

With VyOS, OpenStack users gain a robust, enterprise-grade open source networking platform that serves as an alternative to traditional networking appliances, fully aligned with the principles of open infrastructure.

### What’s Next: VyOS 1.5 and High-Performance Networking

Looking ahead, we’re excited to share that VyOS version 1.5 is scheduled for release in early 2026. This upcoming release will feature significant improvements across stability, performance, and functionality, delivering even greater value to our users and the OpenInfra community.

Beyond that, we’re working on integrating Vector Packet Processing (VPP) into VyOS. VPP will bring cutting-edge performance for high-throughput, low-latency networking, ideal for the large-scale cloud and infrastructure environments that OpenInfra members operate.

### Extending the OpenInfra Vision Into Networking

Our role in the OpenInfra community is to ensure that open networking can be a first-class citizen within open infrastructure. By offering a fully open-source and vendor-neutral routing and firewall platform, we’re helping users maintain openness throughout their stack—from compute and storage, all the way to networking.

We’re proud to be part of this community and look forward to deepening our collaboration as we build a more open, interoperable future together.
