At [Worteks](https://www.worteks.com/), our mission has always been to empower organizations with open, secure, and sovereign digital infrastructure. As a proud member of the OpenInfra Foundation, we’ve embedded these principles into everything we do, from our day-to-day operations to the solutions we provide for our clients.

Worteks became an OpenInfra Member as both a user and contributor of OpenStack. This membership reflects our commitment to a global community pushing the boundaries of open infrastructure. Being part of this ecosystem allows us to stay at the cutting edge of technology while collaborating with peers who share our values.

It also provides access to vital resources, events, and networking opportunities that help us sharpen our skills and grow our impact in the open source world.

### Our Core Focus: OpenStack

When we first deployed our infrastructure, understanding, control, and sovereignty of our data and those of our clients was fundamental. OpenStack came naturally and became the main layer of our infrastructure. We then continued to think of the services around it, adding other open source solutions for storage, deployment, configuration and management. The goal was to give the ability to our collaborators to create their own infrastructure environment for instances and containers as a service and speed up projects. As a result, we now have a cloud offer, [W’aaS](https://www.worteks.com/hebergement/), capable of hosting your most critical software.

Today, we run multiple OpenStack environments, each with 10 to 20 hypervisors. Some are standalone, while others span across multiple sites. These platforms host a variety of workloads, including:

* Web and mail applications
* Kubernetes-based container orchestration
* High-performance computing for data analytics
* GPU-powered applications

This flexibility has helped us build and scale environments tailored to our clients’ needs, whether in a single data center or across distributed locations.

Earlier this year, [we proudly announced](https://www.worteks.com/actualites/2025-01-28-Appel-offre-openstack/) that Worteks was awarded the OpenStack expertise contract launched by the DGFIP (Directorate General of Public Finances) on behalf of numerous French ministries and certain government agencies.

### Introducing W’Opla: Infrastructure, Simplified

From our internal innovations came [W’Opla](https://www.worteks.com/edition/wopla/), our packaged, turnkey infrastructure platform. W’Opla enables our clients to deploy the same powerful stack that we use internally, offering IaaS and CaaS on demand.

The stack combines Ovirt, OpenStack, and OKD as its core, with optional integrations such as:

* Ceph for distributed storage
* Katello and Foreman for software lifecycle and update management
* AWX for automation
* LemonLDAP::NG for identity federation
* EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for centralized logging

Everything is open source, in line with our commitment to transparency and digital sovereignty.

### October Events in France for Open Source Decision Makers 

We’re excited to announce the first edition of a new event tailored for technical decision-makers in large French organizations. This event will dive deep into open source infrastructure trends, featuring hands-on sessions on:

* Optimizing installations
* Designing robust network architectures
* Integrating and operating OpenStack

Conceived and designed specifically for technical decision-makers in large corporations, this is the first club for major OpenStack and Kubernetes users, organized by Worteks. It will take place on the afternoon of October 16 in Paris and aims to showcase the latest advances in open source infrastructure.

Later that week, we are proud to be an Exhibitor sponsor for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/), taking place in Paris-Saclay October 17-19. Within this community event, we also have a session, [Using BGP and ECMP/BFD in Leaf & Spine OpenStack Architecture](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule/#view=calendar&company=worteks). 

### Exploring VMware Alternatives with OpenStack

As part of our broader advocacy for open infrastructure, we've recently published a series of articles in French that explore alternatives to VMware, with a focus on OpenStack as a viable, cost-effective solution.

* [Part 1: Why Look for Alternatives?](https://www.worteks.com/blog/2025-01-08-alternative-a-vmware/)
* [Part 2: How to Compare Virtualization Solutions](https://www.worteks.com/blog/Comment-comparer-les-solutions-de-virtualisation/)
* Part 3 (pricing comparison) is coming later this September — stay tuned!

### Looking Ahead

At Worteks, OpenStack gave us the foundation to build flexible, scalable, and sovereign digital environments, and our involvement in the OpenInfra community ensures we stay aligned with the broader open source movement.

We’re excited about what lies ahead, and even more excited to continue building, sharing, and collaborating with the community.
