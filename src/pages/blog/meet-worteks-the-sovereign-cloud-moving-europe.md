STACKIT, the cloud and colocation provider of Schwarz Group, stands for the sovereign cloud that moves Europe. As such, digital sovereignty is one of our fundamental cornerstones, and adhering to data protection according to European standards is a key priority. To achieve this, independence is a must - economically, technologically and politically. The OpenInfra Foundation provides an open-source infrastructure that aligns with our values, which is why we at STACKIT are proud to be an OpenInfra Member.

## Our Core Focus: Digital Sovereignty

STACKIT primarily works with OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform for building and managing cloud environments without risking a vendor lock-in. In practice, this means data is stored exclusively in STACKIT's own data centers in Germany and Austria. This full control over data storage and processing enables us to meet complex legal and regulatory requirements while remaining flexible, scalable and secure.Our OpenStack deployment currently covers three Availability Zones near Heilbronn, with additional zones under construction in Austria. This geographical distribution allows us to ensure even greater scalability and resilience for our customers.

### Innovation and Engagement

We would like to point to [our scientific deep dive](https://www.stackit.de/de/kontakt-handelsblatt-studie/) for more digital sovereignty in Germany (only available in German). The current geopolitical situation makes it urgently necessary for German companies to strengthen their digital sovereignty. In our pioneering study, which we are currently carrying out together with the Handelsblatt Research Institute, we shed light on the dependence on imported technologies and demonstrate meaningful cloud-based strategies for digital sovereignty for companies.

### Commitment to Upstream Development

STACKIT has a dedicated OpenStack team, which is highly committed to the open-source community. By actively contributing code upstream whenever possible, we ensure that our infrastructure remains at the forefront of innovation. Our contributions range from improving features for OVN migration to fixing bugs in services such as Nova and Neutron. This active involvement shows that STACKIT doesn't just use the technology, but also helps to shape its development.

### Looking Ahead

STACKIT GmbH & Co. KG continues to play an important role in the OpenInfra community. With their ongoing commitment to open source, we are excited to see how they will help shape the future of infrastructure around the world.

Next year, STACKIT will also have their next Cloud X Summit by STACKIT. The event will take place on September 17, 2026 in Wiesbaden. Stay tuned for more information in 2026!
