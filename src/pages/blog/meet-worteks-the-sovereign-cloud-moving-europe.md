[STACKIT](https://www.stackit.de/en/), the cloud and colocation provider of the Schwarz Group, is building the sovereign cloud that powers Europe. Digital sovereignty is not just a principle for us, it is a cornerstone. Adhering to strict European data protection standards is essential, and true sovereignty requires independence on every level: economic, technological, and political.

That is why we are proud to be an OpenInfra Member. The OpenInfra Foundation provides an open source infrastructure model that aligns directly with our values: open, transparent, and community-driven.

### Our Core Focus: Digital Sovereignty

At STACKIT, OpenStack forms the backbone of our cloud infrastructure. By relying on this open source cloud platform, we can build and manage environments without the risks of vendor lock-in.

All customer data is stored exclusively in STACKIT’s own data centers in Germany and Austria. This ensures full control over data storage and processing, allowing us to meet complex legal and regulatory requirements while remaining scalable, secure, and adaptable.

Today, STACKIT’s OpenStack deployment spans three Availability Zones near Heilbronn, with additional zones under construction in Austria. This regional expansion strengthens both scalability and resilience, giving customers confidence in a truly sovereign cloud solution.

### Innovation and Engagement

Digital sovereignty is not just a guiding value, it’s a national priority. To contribute to this effort, STACKIT has partnered with the [Handelsblatt Research Institute](https://research.handelsblatt.com/) on a pioneering study that examines the risks of dependence on imported technologies and proposes cloud-based strategies to strengthen sovereignty for German companies.\

### Commitment to Upstream Development

Our dedicated OpenStack team is deeply engaged with the open source community. By actively contributing code upstream, STACKIT ensures our infrastructure remains at the cutting edge of innovation.

Our contributions include improving OVN migration features and fixing bugs in critical services like Nova and Neutron. This hands-on involvement reflects our philosophy: STACKIT doesn’t just deploy open source, we help shape its future.

### Looking Ahead

STACKIT GmbH & Co. KG is proud to stand alongside the OpenInfra community in advancing the cause of open source infrastructure. With our commitment to sovereignty, upstream development, and community collaboration, we are helping to build an open, secure, and resilient digital future for Europe and beyond.
