The OpenInfra Foundation is excited to welcome Monash University as the latest organization to join the Foundation as an Associate Member. Monash University joins Boston University, CERN, Open Source Business Alliance - Federal Association for Digital Sovereignty, Oregon State University, OW2 and the SODA Foundation. 

“Monash University has participated in the Open Infrastructure community since 2013, with a distinct user perspective - we are a living laboratory of research-driven use cases from all research domains.” said Steve Quenette, Deputy Director of the Monash eResearch Centre. “Open source and in particular the OpenInfra ecosystem is the language by which we craft HPC, highly sensitive, cloud and research data instruments at scale in a way that is closer to research needs, and with access mechanisms that is closer to research practice. We look forward to continued sharing of learnings with the community and pioneering of digital research infrastructure.”

“With their scale, their constraints and the specific capabilities they require, academic and research institutions are a key consumer of Open Infrastructure solutions” said Thierry Carrez, vice president of engineering at the OpenInfra Foundation. “Monash University has long believed in the power of using open source solutions to provide infrastructure for research, so it is with great pleasure that we formalize our long relationship and welcome them as a new associate member.”

Earlier this year, the Open Infrastructure (OpenInfra) Foundation announced its new [Associate Member category](https://openinfra.dev/members/), with participants including Boston University, CERN, Open Source Business Alliance - Federal Association for Digital Sovereignty, OW2 and SODA Foundation. This new category of Foundation members was added by the OpenInfra Foundation board to recognize and collaborate more closely with academic and public research institutions and non-profit organizations that use, build or sustain open infrastructure.
