  title: October 2025 PTG Summary & How the PTG embodies the Four Opens
  description: October 2025 PTG Summary & How the PTG embodies the Four Opens As a
    Foundation, we truly believe that The Four Opens are the recipe for a robust
    and successful open source community. Every project community is different
    in its execution of them, but fundamentally OpenInfra projects run the same.
    Open source. Open design. Open development. Open Community.

The [Project Teams Gathering](https://openinfra.org/ptg/) (PTG) is a manifestation of collaboration keeping The Four Opens at heart and leveraging them to drive the OpenInfra community forward. The last week in October, from the 27th through the 31st we held a PTG that welcomed over 30 teams. Over the course of the week, individual teams scheduled themselves and coordinated technical discussions on a wide range of topics from community goals, to dropping support for eventlet, to planning new features for future releases and addressing feedback from operators and users of the software. Being a free event, open to all, scheduled across a variety of timezones, the PTG really does exemplify Open Community, in particular.

Many of the participating teams have written summaries of their discussions which can be found in the list below:

Across all of these discussions, the PTG had a reported attendance of over 600 participants working together during more than 60 hours of meetings. This PTG, there was also an increase in the number of cross project sessions which brought a lot of energy to the wider community and further affirms the usage of the Four Opens to make open source communities successful and healthy. 

The OpenInfra Project Teams Gathering is always open to open source communities that may not necessarily host their projects with the OpenInfra Foundation.
