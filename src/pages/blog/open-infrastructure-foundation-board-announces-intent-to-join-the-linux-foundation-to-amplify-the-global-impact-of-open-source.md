AUSTIN, Texas, and SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 12, 2025— Today, the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org), the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, announced that the [Open Infrastructure Foundation](https://openinfra.org/) (OpenInfra) has signaled its intent to join as a member foundation, following unanimous approval from both the OpenInfra and Linux Foundation boards. Together, the Linux Foundation and the OpenInfra Foundation will unite their growing, vibrant, global ecosystems to empower users and developers with trusted open source solutions.\
\
Both foundations already work closely together through the [Open Infrastructure Blueprint](https://openinfra.org/open-infrastructure-blueprint-white-paper), an integration for the most active and impactful open source projects in the world: Linux, OpenStack, and Kubernetes. Through the blueprint, critical workloads for hundreds of organizations worldwide are supported, creating unprecedented opportunities to ensure these technologies - and the ecosystems behind them - grow together to outpace proprietary tooling in the face of evolving infrastructure requirements. OpenInfra’s home at the Linux Foundation will also accelerate data center modernization through collaboration with other critical open source projects like Linux, Kubernetes, and PyTorch. \
\
“The data center infrastructure market is undergoing a fundamental reinvention, driven by the colossal demands of AI as well as virtualization migration and digital sovereignty," said Jonathan Bryce, executive director of the OpenInfra Foundation. "The OpenInfra Foundation is already closely aligned with many of the projects housed at the Linux Foundation that are supporting this reinvention, and the timing is perfect to combine resources and build upon our organizations’ work in driving this trillion-dollar market. Together with the Linux Foundation, we can work more closely and collaborate to develop, deploy and shape a future where open source continues to win.”\
\
Artificial intelligence (AI) and data center evolution, combined with geopolitical factors, have created a surge in demand for open source projects. Open source software continues to accelerate innovation of which value moves up the stack, flowing to providers that deliver the best in developer and consumer experiences. Open source has unleashed almost 9 trillion dollars in economic value creation, according to [Harvard researchers](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/open-source-software-the-nine-trillion-resource-companies-take-for-granted).\
\
"We are thrilled to welcome the OpenInfra Foundation to the Linux Foundation,” said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation. “Our rich history of partnership and closely linked communities will propel us in our shared mission to advocate for and advance the power and promise of open source.”\
\
Pending completion of the process, the OpenInfra Foundation will operate within the Linux Foundation. As it supports its open source infrastructure projects, the OpenInfra Foundation will continue to function as it currently does regarding board positions, project governance, budget, memberships and its community-centric approach guided by the principles of [The Four Opens](https://openinfra.org/four-opens/).\

**Supporting Quotes**\
\
“The OpenInfra Foundation enters 2025 with strong momentum. The number of member organizations increased by 15%, including two new Platinum members. Our projects are thriving as well, with OpenStack adoption surging and OpenInfra projects like Kata Containers, StarlingX and Zuul experiencing increased adoption. Coupling our global community—110,000-strong—with the Linux Foundation leverages the power of open source and sets the stage for continued success as we build the next decade of infrastructure.” \
– Julia Kreger, chair of the OpenInfra Board of Directors.\
\
“Throughout history, every leap in human progress has been driven by advances in infrastructure, and today's rapid evolution of AI is no exception. AI and infrastructure are fundamentally intertwined, with AI pushing infrastructure forward through new demands for accelerated compute, scalable platforms like OpenStack, and open-source deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. The greatest AI innovations will thrive within open ecosystems, not proprietary silos. By joining forces, OpenInfra and the Linux Foundation amplify a collaborative community already deeply interconnected, ensuring AI infrastructure is openly developed, community-governed, and accessible—empowering innovators worldwide to freely contribute, adapt, and build upon shared technologies.”\
– Mark Collier, COO of the OpenInfra Foundation.\
\
“As OpenStack Technical Committee (TC) Chair, I want to express our collective support for this transition. We believe that joining forces with the Linux Foundation will strengthen not just OpenStack, but the entire community’s ability to effectively collaborate with the Linux Foundation open source projects and their ecosystems that OpenInfra users already rely on.”\
– Goutham Pacha Ravi, OpenStack TC Chair.

About the Open Infrastructure Foundation

The [OpenInfra Foundation](http://openinfra.org) builds communities who write open source infrastructure software that runs in production. Founded in 2012, the OpenInfra Foundation develops and supports open source infrastructure projects, including [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/), [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/), and [Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/). With the support of over 110,000 individuals in 187 countries, the OpenInfra Foundation hosts open source projects and communities of practice, including infrastructure for AI, container native apps, edge computing and datacenter clouds.
