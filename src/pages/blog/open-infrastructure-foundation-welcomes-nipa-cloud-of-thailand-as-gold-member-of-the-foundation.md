The Open Infrastructure Foundation announces the joining of its newest Gold Member, Nipa Technology Co., a leading cloud service provider based in Thailand. Nipa Technology Co., commonly known as [Nipa Cloud](https://www.nipa.cloud/), is the first company representing Thailand to become a Gold Member of the Foundation. 

Nipa Cloud was launched in 2017 when Nipa Technology, which previously focused on digital marketing and ISP services, received a grant from Thailand’s National Innovation Agency (NIA) to develop leading-edge cloud information technology. That year the company launched the first full-service OpenStack [public clou](https://www.nipa.cloud/blogs/what-is-public-private-cloud)d in Thailand, which was designed and developed fully by Thai talent. The company also developed its own efficiency-enhancing platform software known as Nipa Cloud Platform (NCP), which creates a user-friendly interface for navigating the cloud infrastructure.\
