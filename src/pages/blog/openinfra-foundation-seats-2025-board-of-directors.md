Today, the OpenInfra Foundation seated our 2025 Board of Directors kicking off another year furthering our mission of supporting open source infrastructure communities. 

First, I want to thank Shuquan Huang and Ryan Van Wyk who previously served on the 2024 Board of Directors and welcome Kurt Garloff, ChangBo Guo, Alexander Navratil, Huaxing Zhang and Yulong Liu who are joining the 2025 Board of Directors. 

Meet all of the [2025 OpenInfra Board of Directors](https://openinfra.org/about/board/) and stay tuned for [upcoming open board meetings](https://board.openinfra.org/). 

Together, I look forward to strengthening our projects and Foundation and continuing the [OpenInfra momentum we saw in 2024](https://openinfra.org/blog/2024-openinfra-foundation-annual-report).
