# OpenInfra Foundation Welcomes Hardware, AI Innovator Cachengo as Newest Platinum Member

[Cachengo](https://cachengo.com/) joins global leaders to advance open source infrastructure for AI, storage and edge computing with [OpenStack](https://openstack.org) and OpenInfra community support

*AUSTIN, Texas, May XX, 2025 –* [The Open Infrastructure (OpenInfra) Foundation](https://openinfra.org/) today announced that Cachengo, a pioneer in intelligent edge computing and distributed storage solutions, has joined as its newest Platinum Member. Cachengo will work closely with the global OpenInfra community to accelerate the adoption of open source infrastructure technologies for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and edge-native applications.

Founded by industry veteran (Mylex, VA-Linux, Snap Appliance, Huawei)  Ash Young, [Cachengo](https://cachengo.com/) builds intelligent storage and compute nodes designed to bring processing closer to where data is generated – at the edge. The company’s architecture eliminates the traditional bottlenecks of centralized data centers, unlocking new possibilities for smart cities, industrial automation and real-time analytics.

“Cachengo is committed to enabling a decentralized future,” said Ash Young, CEO of Cachengo. “Open source plays a key role in making that vision real. As we expand our portfolio of edge-native solutions that blend compute and storage, partnering with the OpenInfra Foundation allows us to contribute meaningfully to the community and build on proven technologies like OpenStack. We are thrilled to support and collaborate with OpenInfra to ensure open source thrives at the edge.”

As a Platinum Member, Cachengo will deepen its engagement in OpenInfra-hosted projects that intersect with edge computing, container orchestration and infrastructure automation. The company is especially focused on edge AI workloads and is actively developing open source solutions to support intelligent decision-making at the point of data collection.

“Cachengo represents the innovation we’re needing at the intersection of AI, storage and edge infrastructure,” said Thierry Carrez, general manager of the OpenInfra Foundation. “Their unique approach to smart storage and edge compute hardware combined with OpenInfra software strongly aligns with our vision of open infrastructure being used everywhere – from hyperscale data centers to the outermost edge. We’re excited to welcome them as a Platinum Member.”

Cachengo’s product roadmap outlines the strategic evolution of its infrastructure management solution into a robust platform powered by OpenStack. The initial phase will emphasize the deployment of core OpenStack components, including Nova, Swift, Ironic and Neutron, with plans to evaluate additional services such as Keystone, Horizon and Cinder. In alignment with its adoption of OpenStack, Cachengo is also dedicated to actively contributing to the open source community, particularly through advancements in AI-driven applications.

“Cachengo has identified a strategic market vertical and is taking a bold, technically driven step forward by planning to build a 100% OpenStack-powered architecture,” said Julia Kreger, chair of the OpenInfra Foundation board of directors. “This move highlights not only their long-term vision but also their dedication to open collaboration and active participation in advancing the OpenInfra community and projects.”

Cachengo’s membership signals the growing demand for infrastructure that is lightweight, scalable and optimized for distributed intelligence. With its portfolio of modular hardware and software offerings, the company empowers organizations to deploy resilient AI workloads where they are most effective.
