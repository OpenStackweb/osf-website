Last month, over 650 community members collaborated during 54 different online meetings to discuss next steps in developing open source infrastructure software. Over 34 teams participated representing several OpenStack teams, Kata Containers, StarlingX, OpenInfra working groups as well as an open source community that has been collaborating with the OpenStack community, OceanBase. 

As the communities have concluded these discussions, project leaders have developed summaries to keep the broader community up to date as well as information on where help is needed. 

Check out these summaries and stay tuned on the [PTG website](https://openinfra.dev/ptg/) for when we announce the 2025 events!
