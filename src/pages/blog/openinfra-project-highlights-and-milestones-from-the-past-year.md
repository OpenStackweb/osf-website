The second of OpenInfra Foundationâ€™s key goals for 2024 was to act to support and strengthen OpenInfra projects. [OpenStack](openstack.org), [Kata Containers](katacontainers.io), [StarlingX](starlingx.io) and [Zuul](zuulci.org) are all at different stages of a project life cycle and need slightly different forms of support to increase their adoption and keep them healthy.

OpenInfra project and community progress in 2024 can documented in the following ways:

* Cross-project collaboration progress
* [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/blog/openstack-2024-community-progress-highlights/) community progress
* [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/blog/kata-containers-2024-annual-report/) community progress
* [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/blog/starlingx-2024-annual-report/) community progress
* [Zuul](https://openinfra.dev/annual-report/2024) community progress
