One of the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev/annual-report/openinfra.org)’s key goals for 2024 was to act to protect OpenInfra’s vision of open source: an incredible engine to drive innovation forward and make it accessible to everyone. This vision is being challenged by a broad set of drivers, including geopolitical tensions, incoming regulation, licensing changes on single-vendor open source projects, and actors diluting the meaning of “open source” by applying it to any publicly released AI model.

The OpenInfra Foundation staff and community actively collaborated to address these challenges through various efforts including:

* Addressing upcoming regulations
* Promoting permissionless innovation
* Pushing community-produced open source
* Furthering diversity and inclusion in open source communities
* Positioning OpenInfra software as a digital public good
* Promoting open, collaborative software development along with individual contributors
