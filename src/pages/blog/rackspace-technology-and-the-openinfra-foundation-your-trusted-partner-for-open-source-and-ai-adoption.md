At Rackspace Technology, we know that open source and AI are no longer optional. They are essential for any enterprise that wants to remain competitive in today’s rapidly changing landscape. As Head of Product Strategy and Operations, I see how often customers struggle with the dual challenge of adopting AI at scale while keeping their infrastructure secure, compliant, and cost-effective. This is exactly where Rackspace comes in.

Our long-standing belief is that **open source is the foundation of innovation**. Proprietary black boxes slow organizations down, while open ecosystems accelerate progress through transparency, collaboration, and trust. That is why Rackspace is proud to be a **Platinum Member of the OpenInfra Foundation** and to serve on its **Board of Directors**. This role allows us to be directly involved in shaping the future of open infrastructure and ensure it meets the needs of enterprise customers

## Why Enterprises Need Open Source and AI Together

As enterprises accelerate their AI initiatives, many are also navigating the security implications of open-source software. While new adopters may question its security, open source, particularly the robust communities driving AI innovation, is a catalyst for enterprise-grade security. Open source leverages a transparent, community-driven development model that enables rapid identification and resolution of vulnerabilities. Linus’s Law, the principle that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," captures this advantage well. For enterprises, this means harnessing the collective intelligence of a global community of experts to achieve a level of scrutiny that goes far beyond what a single vendor can provide. By adopting open-source AI with the right governance and operational strategy, enterprises can accelerate innovation while managing risk effectively.

In my view, the enterprises that thrive over the next decade will be those that adopt **AI on top of open, trusted infrastructure**. Anything else will either lack scalability or fail to meet compliance and security demands. Rackspace is uniquely positioned to guide this transition because we bring both deep technical expertise and proven experience in running mission-critical environments for the world’s leading organizations.

## Rackspace’s Role: Trusted Guide from Strategy to Execution

Rackspace has been a leader in **OpenStack** from its earliest days, and today it remains a cornerstone of our portfolio. Building on that foundation, we are helping customers in research, high-performance computing (HPC), and AI deploy infrastructure that is both open and enterprise ready.

We also practice what we preach. Our teams use and contribute to OpenInfra projects like **Zuul** to streamline development and **Kata Containers** to deliver trusted isolation for sensitive AI workloads. These are the same capabilities we extend to our customers, ensuring they benefit from both community-driven innovation and Rackspace’s enterprise-grade delivery.

## Looking Ahead: Partnering With Enterprises for the Future

For enterprises, success in AI and digital transformation is not just about adopting new technology. It is about finding a trusted partner who can navigate complexity, mitigate risk, and accelerate outcomes. That is the role Rackspace Technology plays every day.

Enterprises cannot afford to treat open source and AI adoption as experiments. They need a partner who can combine open-source innovation with enterprise-grade reliability. At Rackspace, we are committed to being that partner. The future of infrastructure is open, intelligent, and built for enterprise trust. And we are proud to be leading that future with the OpenInfra community.

As Head of Product Strategy and Operations, I see Rackspace’s role as both a builder and a bridge. We build enterprise-ready solutions rooted in open source, and we bridge innovation from community projects to enterprise adoption. Our Platinum membership and Board seat in the OpenInfra Foundation allow us to help shape the future direction of open infrastructure, ensuring it remains aligned with the real challenges enterprises face.

AI will not reach its potential without open source, and open source will not remain relevant unless it powers the next wave of AI adoption. Rackspace Technology is committed to leading on both fronts. The future of infrastructure is open, intelligent, and collaborative. We are proud to be shaping that future alongside the OpenInfra community.
