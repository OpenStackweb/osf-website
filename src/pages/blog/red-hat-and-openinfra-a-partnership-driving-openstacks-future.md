At Red Hat, our commitment to open source communities is unwavering, and our relationship with the OpenInfra Foundation is a testament to this core value. Through our Gold membership, we don't just contribute financially; we actively engage to shape the future of open infrastructure, particularly OpenStack. 

Our investment in the OpenInfra community goes deep. We fund direct contributions to code and testing, and Red Hatters consistently serve as core reviewers, Project Team Leads, and Technical Committee members. This direct involvement ensures that our expertise and vision are integrated at every level of development. 

Beyond the technical contributions, our Gold membership provides a crucial path to influence the highest governance structures of the OpenInfra Foundation. Having a Red Hat Board member elected by our fellow Gold member companies sends a strong signal to our customers: our dedication to the upstream community is paramount.

This visible presence in governance forums and at events builds immense customer confidence. As organizations plan years ahead for their OpenStack deployments, knowing that Red Hat is actively involved in ensuring the community's long-term viability provides critical reassurance. Along with our individually elected members, all Red Hatters on the Board are unified in this mission. 

Furthermore, our representatives serve on key sub-committees like Finance, Executive Goals, and Inclusion, allowing us to help shape policy on strategic directions, including the important discussion around accepting AI-generated contributions. 

Ultimately, Red Hat gains significant value from our OpenInfra Foundation membership. It's a strategic investment that reinforces our commitment to open source, strengthens customer confidence in our OpenStack products, and allows us to actively contribute to the sustained innovation and health of the OpenInfra community. This partnership isn't just about membership; it's about leading the way for open infrastructure.
