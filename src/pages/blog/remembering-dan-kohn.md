The open source community mourns the loss of Dan Kohn, one of its key advocates. Always joyful and approachable, Dan was instrumental in forming a cloud-native ecosystem on top of Kubernetes at the CNCF. Beyond that engagement, he brought his enthusiasm to spread the word about all open source software. An Internet commerce pioneer, he was a strong believer of how technical innovation can help create the foundations for building a better world. 

Many of us had the opportunity to see him in action as we travelled around the world. He will be missed. Our thoughts go to his family, friends, and colleagues and all who were impacted by his life.

The CNCF has created a GitHub repository for sharing memories of Dan: [https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/master/dan-kohn.md](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/master/dan-kohn.md)
