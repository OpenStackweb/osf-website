## **Accelerating Open Source Cloud Innovation Across Vietnam and Southeast Asia**

The OpenInfra Foundation is proud to welcome [Viettel](https://viettel.com.vn/en/), Vietnam’s largest telecommunications and technology group, as our newest Platinum Member. As the first organization in Vietnam to join at this highest level of membership, Viettel is signaling a bold, long-term commitment to open source infrastructure, digital sovereignty, and the global OpenInfra community.

Viettel’s investment reflects a clear vision: open source is essential to building secure, scalable digital infrastructure, not only for Vietnam, but for the tens of millions of people served across Viettel’s global footprint.

## **A Global Leader Driving Digital Transformation**

Established in 1989, Viettel has grown into one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands. Today, the company operates across 11 countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, employs over 50,000 people, and serves as a core driver of Vietnam’s national digital-transformation strategy.

This leadership extends beyond connectivity. Viettel develops cybersecurity technologies, high-tech defense systems, and cloud platforms that power government, enterprise, and public-service digital modernization programs.

Their mission, "Pioneering to create a digital society", is rooted in a belief that technology should make life richer, safer, and more connected.

## **One of Southeast Asia’s Largest OpenStack Deployments**

Viettel has made open source, and OpenStack specifically, central to its cloud strategy. Through its infrastructure subsidiary, [Viettel IDC](https://viettelidc.com.vn/), the company operates a massive OpenStack footprint powering private cloud, public cloud, AI/ML platforms, security services, and national-scale digital initiatives.

This scale makes Viettel one of the largest OpenStack operators in Southeast Asia and a cornerstone example of open source powering sovereign cloud infrastructure. 

“Open source is at the heart of Viettel’s cloud strategy,” shared Hieu Le, CIO of Viettel, in the announcement. “By building our infrastructure on OpenStack, we give customers something they cannot achieve with proprietary platforms: full control, competitive costs, and uncompromising security.”

## **A Complete Cloud Ecosystem Powered by Open Source**

Viettel Cloud’s portfolio spans the entire cloud stack, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and managed services, all engineered with the flexibility and sovereignty made possible by OpenStack.

* IaaS: Virtual Private Cloud, Dedicated Private Cloud, GPU Cloud, block/file/object storage
* PaaS: Kubernetes Engine, AI/ML services (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MLflow), databases, security services
* SaaS: camera surveillance platforms, cybersecurity tools, productivity applications
* Managed Services: cloud consulting, SOC, endpoint security, DRaaS, hybrid connectivity
* Regional-leading data centers: 50,000 racks deployed today, expanding to 60,000+ racks across 24 data centers by 2030 (illustrated on page 6).

This ecosystem supports enterprises, government agencies, smart city initiatives, and critical national infrastructure across Vietnam.

Importantly, Viettel is the first cloud provider to meet Vietnam’s e-Government Cloud standards, demonstrating the essential role of open source in national digital-sovereignty strategies.

## **Strengthening OpenInfra Through Knowledge, Innovation, and Investment**

In their presentation to the board, Viettel outlined the pillars of their Platinum Member commitment:

* Contributing technical knowledge
* Driving innovation and leading new technology development
* Investing resources to support the global community

This includes expanding engineering participation in OpenStack and other OpenInfra projects, contributing to technical roadmaps, and collaborating with member organizations across the region and the world.

“Viettel is driving one of the most significant national cloud transformations in Southeast Asia,” said Thierry Carrez, general manager of the OpenInfra Foundation. “Their investments illustrate the global relevance of open source for governments, public services, and critical industries.”

Julia Kreger, chair of the OpenInfra Foundation Governing Board, added that Viettel’s leadership “reinforces the momentum we’re seeing worldwide as organizations seek open, vendor-neutral alternatives for mission-critical workloads.”

## **Expanding OpenInfra Collaboration Across Asia and Beyond**

Viettel joins an extraordinary group of global organizations, including Ant Group, Cachengo, Ericsson, Huawei, Okestro, Rackspace, and Wind River, collaborating as Platinum Members to advance open infrastructure for AI, cloud, edge, and datacenter environments.

Their experience operating hyperscale OpenStack clusters, securing sovereign cloud platforms, and building cloud ecosystems for national transformation will be invaluable to the community.

From telecom to defense, from AI infrastructure to Kubernetes, Viettel’s portfolio aligns directly with OpenInfra’s mission to build production-hardened, open source infrastructure that empowers organizations around the world.

## **Welcome to Platinum Membership, Viettel**

Viettel’s Platinum Membership represents a major milestone, not only for Vietnam’s cloud ecosystem but for the global OpenInfra community.

Their leadership strengthens our shared commitment to:

* Open collaboration
* Vendor-neutral infrastructure
* Digital sovereignty
* Innovation at global scale

We look forward to collaborating with Viettel as they help shape the future of OpenStack and open infrastructure across Southeast Asia and worldwide.
