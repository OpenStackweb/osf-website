![Welcome Viettel - OpenInfra Foundation Platinum Member](/img/1200x675-platinum-viettel.png)

The OpenInfra Foundation is proud to welcome [Viettel](https://viettel.com.vn/en/), Vietnam’s largest telecommunications and technology group, as our newest Platinum Member. Viettel is the first organization in Vietnam to join at this highest level of membership, and their commitment reflects the growing prominence of open source infrastructure across Southeast Asia.

This milestone is especially meaningful for the OpenInfra community. Vietnam has been one of the most active and enthusiastic regions in the world. For the past eight years, the Foundation has proudly supported OpenInfra Days Vietnam, helping build a strong ecosystem of engineers, operators, students and organizations. I have had the privilege of visiting Vietnam four times to support this growth and to deepen relationships with Viettel and many others who are advancing open source in the country.

The [Vietnam OpenInfra User Group](https://www.meetup.com/vietopenstack/) captured the significance of this moment in a recent reflection on Viettel’s transformation. In their words:

“Viettel's membership upgrade signifies a major strategic shift, evolving from a consumer of open-source technology to a leader in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. This move sends a strong, positive message to the tech ecosystem, reinforcing Viettel's long-standing support for community building, not only with the Vietnam OpenInfra User Group and the Cloud Native Community in Vietnam, but also through events like technical meetups and OpenInfra Days Vietnam. We look forward to Viettel's continued leadership across the Asian market. We also hope this milestone serves as a catalyst for other cloud providers to strengthen their commitment to the open-source community, fostering innovation that delivers tangible value to society.”

That spirit has shaped the open source movement in Vietnam for nearly a decade, and it aligns closely with the commitment Viettel brings as a Platinum Member.

## A Global Leader With a Vision for Digital Society

Viettel has grown into one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands, operating in 11 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. With more than 50,000 employees, the company plays a central role in Vietnam’s national digital strategy and delivers services across mobile connectivity, cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI and digital government.

The company’s mission centers on building a digital society that improves people’s lives. This vision aligns directly with the OpenInfra Foundation’s belief that open infrastructure enables transparency, collaboration and shared innovation across borders and industries.

## Building One of Southeast Asia’s Largest OpenStack Clouds

[Viettel IDC](https://viettelidc.com.vn/), the business unit responsible for cloud and data center operations, has deployed one of the largest OpenStack-based infrastructures in Southeast Asia. Their cloud underpins digital services for enterprises, government agencies and critical national programs.

Their OpenStack environment includes 15 private cloud clusters, more than 3,500 physical servers, over 112,000 compute cores, 1,200 terabytes of RAM and more than 11,000 terabytes of storage. This scale demonstrates Viettel’s belief that open source platforms provide the flexibility, security and cost efficiency required for modern sovereign cloud architectures.

Viettel is also the first cloud provider to meet Vietnam’s official e-Government Cloud standards, reinforcing how open source supports national digital transformation priorities.

## A Complete Open Source Cloud Ecosystem

Viettel Cloud delivers a comprehensive suite of open technologies, including Kubernetes-based container platforms, AI and machine learning services, big data analytics, cloud security and a growing collection of SaaS applications for both enterprises and public institutions.

Supporting this ecosystem is Viettel’s expanding Tier III data center network. Today the company operates 50,000 racks and plans to exceed 60,000 racks across 24 data centers by 2030, placing Viettel among the largest data center providers in Southeast Asia.

## Deepening the Partnership With the OpenInfra Community

As a Platinum Member, Viettel will contribute engineering expertise, participate in technical governance and collaborate with the global community on the advancement of open cloud, edge and AI infrastructure. Their operational experience running hyperscale OpenStack clusters at national scale will provide valuable insight for operators worldwide.

For the OpenInfra Foundation, Viettel’s membership reflects the continuation of a long-term investment in Vietnam’s open source landscape. The country has demonstrated extraordinary potential and enthusiasm for collaborative technology development, and Viettel’s leadership marks a significant moment in that ongoing journey.

## Welcome, Viettel

We are excited to welcome Viettel as a Platinum Member and look forward to the innovation, collaboration and leadership they will bring to the global OpenInfra community. This partnership highlights the momentum of open infrastructure across Southeast Asia and underscores the essential role open source continues to play in shaping the future of cloud, AI and digital transformation.

Welcome to Platinum Membership, Viettel. We look forward to building what comes next together.
