## Strengthening Open Source Cloud Innovation Across Vietnam and Southeast Asia

The OpenInfra Foundation is proud to welcome [Viettel](https://viettel.com.vn/en/), Vietnam’s largest telecommunications and technology group, as our newest Platinum Member. Viettel is the first organization in Vietnam to join at this highest level of membership, and their commitment reinforces the growing importance of open source infrastructure across Southeast Asia.

This milestone is especially meaningful for the OpenInfra community. Vietnam has been one of the most active and passionate OpenInfra regions in the world. For the past eight years, the Foundation has proudly supported OpenInfra Days Vietnam, helping build a strong local community of engineers, operators, students and innovators. I have had the privilege of traveling to Vietnam four times to help develop relationships with Viettel and many other organizations in the country. Each visit made it even more clear that Vietnam is becoming one of the most dynamic centers for open source infrastructure anywhere in Asia.

That long-term partnership makes Viettel’s Platinum Membership a natural next step. It reflects both their leadership in cloud and digital transformation and their desire to contribute more deeply to the global OpenInfra ecosystem.

## A Global Leader With a Vision for Digital Society

Viettel has grown into one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands, operating in 11 countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. With more than 50,000 employees, the company plays a central role in Vietnam’s national digital transformation strategy and delivers services ranging from mobile connectivity to cybersecurity, cloud computing and AI.

The company’s mission is focused on building a digital society that improves people’s lives. That mission aligns closely with OpenInfra’s belief that open source technologies empower nations, enterprises and communities through transparency, collaboration and shared innovation.

## Building One of Southeast Asia’s Largest OpenStack Clouds

[Viettel IDC](https://viettelidc.com.vn/), the business unit responsible for cloud and data center operations, has deployed one of the largest OpenStack-based infrastructures in the region. Their cloud serves enterprises, government agencies, smart city initiatives and critical digital services throughout Vietnam.

Today their OpenStack environment spans 15 private cloud clusters, more than 3,500 physical servers, over 112,000 compute cores, 1,200 terabytes of RAM and more than 11,000 terabytes of storage capacity. This scale demonstrates Viettel’s belief that open source provides the flexibility, security and cost control required for modern sovereign cloud platforms.

Viettel is also the first cloud provider to meet Vietnam’s official e-Government Cloud standards. This reinforces the role of open source in supporting national-level digital modernization and secure cloud adoption.

## A Complete Open Source Cloud Ecosystem

Beyond infrastructure, Viettel Cloud offers a broad suite of services built on open technologies. This includes Kubernetes-based container platforms, AI and machine learning services, cloud security solutions, big data platforms and a growing portfolio of SaaS applications for both enterprises and public sector organizations.

Their cloud ecosystem is supported by Viettel’s rapidly expanding Tier III data center network. The company currently operates 50,000 racks and plans to grow to more than 60,000 racks across 24 data centers by 2030, making it one of the largest and most advanced data center providers in Southeast Asia.

## Deepening the Partnership With the OpenInfra Community

As a Platinum Member, Viettel will contribute engineering expertise, participate in technical committees and collaborate with the global community on the next generation of open cloud technologies. Their experience operating hyperscale OpenStack clusters at national scale will bring valuable insights to the project and to other operators around the world.

For the OpenInfra Foundation, Viettel’s membership represents the continuation of a long-term investment. Vietnam has consistently demonstrated the power of open source in accelerating national digital transformation. The commitment from Viettel marks a major moment in that journey and strengthens our shared mission of building open infrastructure that runs in production for millions of people.

## Welcome, Viettel

We are excited to welcome Viettel as a Platinum Member and look forward to the innovation, collaboration and leadership they will bring to the global OpenInfra community. This partnership reflects the incredible momentum across Southeast Asia and highlights how open source infrastructure continues to shape the future of cloud, AI and digital transformation.

Welcome to Platinum Membership, Viettel. We look forward to building what comes next together.
