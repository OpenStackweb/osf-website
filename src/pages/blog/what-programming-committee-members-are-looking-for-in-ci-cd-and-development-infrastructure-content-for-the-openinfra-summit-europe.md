We’re excited to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **CI/CD and Development Infrastructure** track will spotlight how open infrastructure is transforming the way software is built, tested, and delivered at scale.

We’re looking for session proposals that dig into the real-world implementation of continuous integration and delivery pipelines, automation strategies, tooling, and developer environments. Whether you're scaling CI/CD in hybrid clouds, integrating open source tools to streamline development workflows, or fostering collaboration across teams and platforms — your experience can help others build more reliable, efficient, and innovative infrastructure.

**[Submit your session proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and help shape a program that empowers developers and operators to optimize the full lifecycle of software delivery with open infrastructure.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* Methods for self-service and reducing barriers in CI/CD workflows.
* Strategies to reduce or eliminate flaky tests and the challenges they cause.
* Hands-on workshops based on real CI/CD use cases for validation and experimentation.
* Integrating DevOps practices in highly regulated or telco-grade infrastructure.
* Leveraging GitOps for continuous delivery and infrastructure management.
* Building secure software supply chains using open source tools.
* Ensuring reproducible builds within development pipelines.
* Real-world examples of CI strategy failures and how teams recovered.
* Experiences sharing the organic growth and evolution of CI approaches within organizations.
