We’re thrilled to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **Container Infrastructure** track will dive deep into the technologies and practices powering modern containerized environments, from orchestration and runtime to networking and security.

We’re seeking session proposals that explore real-world container infrastructure challenges and solutions—whether that’s scaling Kubernetes clusters, optimizing container runtimes, advancing service mesh implementations, enhancing container security, or innovating storage and networking for containers. If you’re working on making container infrastructure more resilient, scalable, and developer-friendly across diverse environments, your insights can help the community drive the next wave of open infrastructure innovation.

**[Submit your session proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and join us in shaping a track that empowers operators and developers to build robust, scalable, and secure container infrastructure at scale.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* Insights and best practices around Kata Containers and other lightweight virtualization technologies that enhance container security and isolation.
* Real-world war stories from running Kubernetes and related projects at scale — not just happy-path demos. Deep dives into observability, scheduling, CNI/CSI chaos, upgrade challenges, and how people debug unexpected behavior. Bonus points for multi-cluster or multi-tenant scenarios.
* A diverse mix of projects and use cases, including both well-known/popular projects and lesser-known but effective tools. Sessions that highlight different approaches can help attendees discover new solutions and inspire community involvement.
* Talks covering a range of expertise levels: introductory overviews, advanced use cases, and developer onboarding tips.
* Sessions that demystify containers, showcasing practical ways containers are used in production and development environments.
