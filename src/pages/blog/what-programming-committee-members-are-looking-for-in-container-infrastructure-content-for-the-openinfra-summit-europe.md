real-world war stories from running k8s and friends at scale, not just happy-path demos. deep dives into observability, scheduling, cni/csi chaos, upgrades gone wrong, and how people actually debug weird behavior. bonus points for anything multi-cluster or multi-tenant.

**Qihui Zhao**

China Mobile Research Institute

**Sean McGinnis**

Lambda AI | Software Engineer

I would love to see a good mix of projects and the different use cases they are able to address. Typically only a small few get much attention, and this is good for gaining traction and shaping projects that can help many users. But there are also always a few that a very good at meeting their focus area that may not be as visible, even though they may be perfect for many users. Having a good mix of the well known and popular projects, along with a few things that could be interesting discoveries, can help motivate others to get involved or try things out. Ideally with talks that are a mix of introductory material, advanced use cases, and some developer onboarding pointers.
