We’re thrilled to welcome the global open infrastructure community to **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! As the digital landscape grows more complex and interconnected, the importance of **digital sovereignty**—the ability to control and protect data, infrastructure, and technologies on your own terms—has never been greater.

The **Digital Sovereignty** track is your opportunity to help define what autonomy looks like in the age of global-scale open infrastructure. If you’re building frameworks for data control, navigating cross-border governance, or deploying decentralized systems in the wild, **we want to hear from you**.

**[Submit your proposal by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and help us shine a light on how open source can support resilient, self-determined digital futures for nations, regions, and organizations alike.

## What We’re Looking For

The Programming Committee is especially interested in:

* **Innovative, practical frameworks for achieving data autonomy** in a global context—solutions that balance openness with control and compliance.  
* **Explorations of decentralized infrastructure** models that can empower local or regional digital control while maintaining interoperability.  
* **Effective cross-border data governance strategies**, especially those built around open standards and community collaboration.  
* **Compelling case studies** that showcase real-world implementations of digital sovereignty using open-source technologies.  
* **Forward-looking visions** that illustrate how digital sovereignty can evolve through collaboration, openness, and technological leadership.  
* **“Stories from the trenches”**—lessons learned, challenges overcome, and tools developed that save time, reduce complexity, and increase autonomy.  
* **Pragmatic development roadmaps**—proposals grounded in real-world demand and use cases, not just hype.  
* **Federated cloud deployments**—examples of multiple OpenStack clouds operating together under unified identity systems, with cross-cloud billing, resource sharing, and user management.  
* **Engagement by public officials**—talks that highlight how governments and institutions are supporting or implementing digital sovereignty initiatives.
