For the Digital Sovereignty track, I would like to see submissions showcasing innovative, practical frameworks for achieving data autonomy and control in a global context. Let's explore decentralized infrastructures, effective cross-border data governance strategies, and concrete examples of how open-source empowers digital independence for nations and organizations. We need compelling case studies of successful implementations and forward-thinking visions for the future of digital sovereignty.
