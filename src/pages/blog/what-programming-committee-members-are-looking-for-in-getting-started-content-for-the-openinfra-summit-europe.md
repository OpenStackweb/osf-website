Here is what members of the Programming Committee are looking for in the Getting Started track for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)! [Submit your proposals](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/) by June 13.

**Egine Nalbandian**

Sardina Systems | Marketing Lead

Content should be welcoming and beginner-friendly, providing hands-on guides, real-life examples, and interactive demos to ease the learning curve of OpenInfra technologies. I’d like to see sessions focused on practical entry points—such as navigating documentation, architecture basics, and initial deployment tips. Talks that highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them would also be highly valuable.

**Lucky Joseph Hassan**

UNICEF | Open-Source Community Manager

I would love to see sessions that serve as true entry points into the open infrastructure ecosystem. This includes beginner-friendly workshops on how to get started with open source, how to discover major projects and make contributions e.g. OpenStack, and practical steps for making your first contribution, from setting up the development environment to understanding how issues, pull requests, and community norms work.

I would also like to have some content guide beginners through major tools and basics they need before jumping into the deep—like learning to start with Git/GitHub, understanding starting cloud infrastructure, and open community concepts. Such sessions with a focus on real contributor experience, community welcoming practices, and hands-on small projects would make this track easier and more inspirational for beginners.

**Seongsoo Cho**

NHN Cloud | System Engineer / OpenStack Engineer

I would especially like to see talks that share hands-on knowledge and troubleshooting experiences related to setting up public clouds across multiple regions—particularly around Keystone configuration and building self-service networks.
