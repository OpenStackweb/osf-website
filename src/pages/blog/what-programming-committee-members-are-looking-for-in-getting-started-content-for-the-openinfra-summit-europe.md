We’re excited to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **Getting Started** track is designed to help newcomers and those early in their open infrastructure journey build a strong foundation. Whether you’re just beginning to explore open infrastructure technologies—such as cloud platforms, container orchestration, edge computing, or storage solutions—this track will provide practical guidance, foundational concepts, and real-world examples to get you up and running with confidence.

We’re looking for session proposals that simplify complex technologies and demystify open infrastructure tools and projects. If you’re passionate about making open infrastructure more accessible—through beginner-friendly tutorials, walkthroughs, best practices, or community onboarding stories—your insights will be invaluable to those just starting out.

**[Submit your session proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and help us create a track that welcomes and empowers the next generation of open infrastructure contributors, operators, and enthusiasts.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is especially interested in proposals that focus on:

* Content should be welcoming and beginner-friendly, providing hands-on guides, real-life examples, and interactive demos to ease the learning curve of OpenInfra technologies.
* Sessions focused on practical entry points such as navigating documentation, architecture basics, and initial deployment tips.
* Talks that highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them.
* Beginner-friendly workshops on how to get started with open source and how to discover major projects like OpenStack.
* Practical steps for making your first contribution, including setting up the development environment and understanding issues, pull requests, and community norms.
* Guides through major tools and basics needed before diving deeper, such as learning Git/GitHub, starting with cloud infrastructure, and understanding open community concepts.
* Sessions emphasizing real contributor experiences, community welcoming practices, and hands-on small projects to inspire beginners.
