We’re thrilled to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **Hands-on Workshops** track is all about diving deep into practical skills and real-world solutions alongside the open infrastructure community.

We invite you to lead interactive, hands-on sessions that empower attendees to build, troubleshoot, and innovate across a wide range of open source cloud and infrastructure technologies. Whether it’s step-by-step labs, guided workshops on emerging tools, or practical sessions focused on operator workflows and developer contributions — your workshop can make a direct impact by giving participants tangible takeaways and skills.

**[Submit your workshop proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and help shape a dynamic, engaging experience that equips the community to confidently advance open infrastructure projects and practices.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* Workshops covering operational challenges, common issues, and practical fixes for cloud operators.
* Hands-on sessions focused on large-scale deployments and public cloud operational practices.
* Beginner-friendly workshops introducing the open infrastructure ecosystem and how to get started with open source.
* Practical, step-by-step workshops on discovering major projects like OpenStack and making your first contribution.
* Guided hands-on sessions for setting up development environments and understanding community workflows (issues, pull requests, community norms).
* Workshops teaching foundational tools and concepts such as Git/GitHub, basic cloud infrastructure, and open community engagement.
* Interactive sessions focused on real contributor experiences, community welcoming practices, and small hands-on projects to inspire and empower beginners.
