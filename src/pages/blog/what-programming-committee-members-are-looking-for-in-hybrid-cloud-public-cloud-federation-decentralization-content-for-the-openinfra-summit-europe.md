We’re thrilled about the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)** and eager to connect with the community! As we gear up for another dynamic gathering of developers, operators, and cloud innovators, the Programming Committee for the **Hybrid Cloud, Public Cloud, Federation, Decentralization** track invites forward-thinking and practical session proposals.

We want to hear about **cutting-edge strategies and implementations that enable seamless hybrid and public cloud integration, federated architectures, and decentralized cloud ecosystems**. Whether it’s pioneering federation models that empower collaboration across independent clouds, or real-world deployments that demonstrate resilience, scalability, and sovereignty — your insights will help define the future of cloud infrastructure. **[Submit your talks by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)**, and join us in shaping the next wave of open cloud technology.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* Managing federated cloud deployments with multiple OpenStack clouds working together under unified identity and cross-cloud resource tracking and billing  
* Designing and managing hybrid cloud environments that combine private and public clouds for compliance, performance, and cost efficiency  
* Real-world examples of federated cloud implementations and decentralization strategies  
* Multi-cloud orchestration, workload governance, and leveraging open standards for workload portability  
* Edge-cloud integration addressing data sovereignty and regulatory compliance  
* Hybrid architectures focused on maximizing resilience, security, and control with OpenInfra technologies
