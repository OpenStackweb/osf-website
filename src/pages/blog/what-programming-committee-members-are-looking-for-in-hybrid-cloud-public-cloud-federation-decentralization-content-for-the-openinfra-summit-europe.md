Here is what members of the Programming Committee are looking for in the Hybrid Cloud, Public Cloud, Federation, Decentralization track for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)! [Submit your proposals](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/) by June 13.

StackHPC | solutions architect

I would like to see things like the state and advances for automating OpenStack deployments using kolla-ansible.

Updates about confidential computing and Nova and things like Kata containers would also be interesting.

I'd really like to see how people are managing federated cloud deployments, where multiple OS clouds are working together with a single identity, ideally with cross-cloud resource use tracking and billing, etc.

Efforts and understanding by public officials about the importance of using, improving and funding FOSS software and OpenStack would also be very good.

And all things security i'm interested in too!

Sardina Systems | Executive Director

* How organizations are designing and managing hybrid cloud environments using OpenInfra technologies, combining private cloud and public cloud to meet compliance, performance, and cost-efficiency goals. 
* Real-world implementations of federated cloud environments and decentralization strategies. 
* Multi-cloud orchestration, workload governance, and the role of open standards in enabling seamless workload portability. 
* Edge-cloud integration and solutions addressing data sovereignty and regulatory requirements. 
* How organizations are designing hybrid architectures to maximize resilience, security, and control using OpenInfra technologies.

**Seongsoo Cho**

NHN Cloud | System Engineer / OpenStack Engineer

I’d love to see submissions that explore real-world implementations and technical challenges of hybrid and public cloud infrastructures, especially those involving OpenStack.

I would especially like to see talks that share hands-on knowledge and troubleshooting experiences related to setting up public clouds across multiple regions—particularly around Keystone configuration and building self-service networks.

**Zvonko Kaiser**

NVIDIA | Principal System Engineer

* the intersection of different areas like HPC on cloud-native stacks with confidential computing,
* e2e enterprise pipelines for secure AI 
* infrastructure blueprints for any use-case 
* VIrtualization ideas beyond KVM/QEMU, like the secondary VM model to not do nested virt 
* How to protect confidential data, confidential storage, not secure storage that we have today 
* Confidential computing use cases, user stories so we, as the community,y can build the proper infrastructure
