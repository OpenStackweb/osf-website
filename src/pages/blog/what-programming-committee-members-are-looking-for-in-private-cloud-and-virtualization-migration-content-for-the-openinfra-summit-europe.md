We’re excited for the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)** and can’t wait to connect with the community! As we prepare for another inspiring gathering of developers, operators, and cloud pioneers, the Programming Committee for the **Private Cloud and Virtualization Migration** track invites innovative and practical session proposals.

We want to explore **advanced approaches and real-world experiences in migrating workloads to private clouds and modernizing virtualization environments**. Whether you’re driving successful transitions from legacy virtualization platforms, leveraging open-source tools to optimize private cloud deployments, or pioneering hybrid strategies that blend private and virtualized resources — your expertise will help guide the evolution of enterprise cloud infrastructure. **[Submit your talks by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and be part of shaping the future of private cloud and virtualization migration.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* Modernization of legacy infrastructure and the transition from proprietary virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware) to open source alternatives such as OpenStack.  
* Migration strategies, ROI-driven decision-making, automation techniques, and performance comparisons.  
* Case studies demonstrating cost savings, improved scalability, and increased operational efficiency.  
* Real-world challenges during migration and how they were successfully overcome.  
* Best practices for running virtual machines and containers side-by-side, including approaches to bridging skill gaps within teams.  
* Security, automation, and lifecycle management solutions tailored to private cloud environments.  
* Private cloud architecture best practices, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), CI/CD integration, observability, self-service portals, and hybrid-cloud readiness.
