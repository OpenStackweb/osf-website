Submissions should focus on real-world migration stories—especially transitions from VMware to open source solutions like OpenStack. I’d like to see practical sessions that demystify planning and execution, showcase automation strategies, and explore the cost and flexibility benefits of private cloud adoption. Ideally, this content should be accessible to both technical audiences and decision-makers, bridging the gap between infrastructure teams and business leadership.

* Modernization of legacy infrastructure and the transition from proprietary virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware) to open source alternatives such as OpenStack. 
* Migration strategies, ROI-driven decision-making, automation techniques, and performance comparisons. 
* Case studies demonstrating cost savings, improved scalability, and increased operational efficiency. 
* Real-world challenges during migration and how they were successfully overcome.
* Best practices for running virtual machines and containers side-by-side, including approaches to bridging skill gaps within teams. 
* Security, automation, and lifecycle management solutions tailored to private cloud environments. 
* Private cloud architecture best practices, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), CI/CD integration, observability, self-service portals, and hybrid-cloud readiness.

Red Hat | Principal Software Engineer and OpenStack Technical Committee Chair

For the Private Cloud and Virtualization Migration track, I'd like to see migration strategies, economics, and tools to aid the existing OpenStack landscape in VM Migration across clouds. I'd like to see OpenStack projects being extended and utilized, and war stories detailing the same.
