Here is what members of the Programming Committee are looking for in the Scientific Use Cases and HPC track for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)! [Submit your proposals](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/) by June 13.

**Ali Hussain**

ArchBits | Software Engineer and Open Source Evangelist

Content showing the convergence of HPC and cloud-native paradigms would be valuable, especially in federated environments and containerized HPC workloads on OpenStack or Kubernetes.

**Armstrong Foundjem**

École Polytechnique Montréal | Research Scientist in AI

I would like to see submissions that explore how AI and ML can enhance the resilience, scalability, and sustainability of open infrastructure. This includes intelligent automation for CI/CD workflows, energy-aware scheduling, AI-driven observability, and explainable ML systems for DevSecOps. I also encourage talks on federated learning, agent-based orchestration, and real-world integrations of AI in OpenStack, Kubernetes, and edge computing environments.

**Axel Simon**

StackHPC | Solutions Architect 

I would like to see things like the state and advances for automating OpenStack deployments using kolla-ansible. Efforts and understanding by public officials about the importance of using, improving and funding FOSS software and OpenStack would also be very good.
