We’re thrilled to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **Scientific Use Cases and HPC** track highlights the critical role open infrastructure plays in enabling cutting-edge research, high performance computing, and large-scale data-driven science.

We invite you to share your expertise through sessions that explore how open source technologies are accelerating scientific discovery and powering complex computational workloads. Whether it's real-world case studies, best practices in deploying HPC workloads, or collaborative efforts between research institutions and industry — your insights can inspire and equip attendees to harness open infrastructure for impactful scientific innovation.

**[Submit your session proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and contribute to a compelling program that showcases how open infrastructure is driving progress in science, research, and HPC.

## What We’re Looking For

The committee is particularly excited to see proposals focused on:

* The convergence of HPC and cloud-native paradigms, especially in federated environments  
* Containerized HPC workloads running on OpenStack or Kubernetes  
* Use of AI/ML to enhance resilience, scalability, and sustainability of scientific infrastructure  
* Energy-aware scheduling and intelligent automation for HPC workloads  
* Federated learning and agent-based orchestration in scientific computing  
* Real-world case studies integrating AI/ML in OpenStack, Kubernetes, or edge environments for research  
* Advances in automating OpenStack deployments using tools like Kolla Ansible  
* Government and public sector engagement in supporting, funding, and improving open source infrastructure for science and research
