We’re excited for the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)** and can’t wait to hear from the community! As we prepare for another incredible gathering of developers, operators, and technologists, the Programming Committee for the **Security & Confidential Computing** track is on the lookout for insightful, practical, and forward-thinking sessions.

If you’re working on innovative security solutions, confidential computing strategies, or tackling real-world infrastructure challenges, we want your story on stage. **[Submit your proposal by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and help us shape the future of secure, open infrastructure—without the unnecessary complexity.

## What We’re Looking For

Here’s the type of content the committee is excited to see:

* **Beyond the basics**: Go further than “just use a scanner” — share real tactics like:

  * Hardened pipelines  
  * Exploit case studies  
  * Sandboxing tradeoffs  
  * Real-world supply chain attacks  
  * Practical compliance approaches that avoid unnecessary bureaucracy  
* **Stories from the trenches**:

  * Real-world security or privacy incidents and how you tackled them  
  * Lessons learned that others can apply to save time, effort, or cost  
* **Cutting-edge advancements and practical implementations**:

  * Confidential computing breakthroughs and real-world use cases  
  * Secure, scalable, and accessible zero-trust architectures  
* **Talks at the intersection of tech domains**:

  * Confidential computing + cloud-native HPC  
  * Infrastructure blueprints for a range of security-focused use cases  
* **Innovative architecture & infrastructure ideas**:

  * Alternatives to traditional virtualization (e.g., secondary VM models)  
  * Protecting confidential vs. merely “secure” storage  
  * Community-driven infrastructure shaped by real user stories
