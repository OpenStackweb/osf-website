Here is what the Programming Committee is looking for in the Security, Confidential Computing track for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)! [Submit your proposals](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/) by June 13.

Stuff that goes beyond "use a scanner" â€”like hardened pipelines, exploit case studies, sandboxing tradeoffs, supply chain attacks in the wild, or how orgs deal with compliance without becoming Kafkaesque

\_\_\_\__

I am primarily interested in three types of submissions: 

(1) "Stories from the trenches", with relevance to a broad public and with clear and impactful lessons learned that save time and money for others.
(2) pragmatic directions for development - suggestions and visions for the evolution of open infrastructure projects that are based on known market traction and demand (rather than hype).

\_\_\_\__

In the Security & Confidential Computing track, I'm looking for submissions presenting groundbreaking data protection and privacy approaches. Encourage talks that delve into cutting-edge confidential computing advancements, practical zero-trust implementations, and the responsible application of AI in security. Highlight real-world use cases demonstrating a strong balance between strong security and user accessibility, while also addressing the ethical considerations of emerging security technologies.

I am interested in seeing talks on:

* the intersection of different areas like HPC on cloud-native stacks with confidential computing,
* e2e enterprise pipelines for secure AI 
* infrastructure blueprints for any use-case 
* VIrtualization ideas beyond KVM/QEMU, like the secondary VM model to not do nested virt 
* How to protect confidential data, confidential storage, not secure storage that we have today 
* Confidential computing use cases, user stories so we, as the community,y can build the proper infrastructure
