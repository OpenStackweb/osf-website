Here is what members of the Programming Committee are looking for in the AI Infrastructure track for the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)! [Submit your proposals](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/) by June 13.

**Ali Hussain**

ArchBits | Software Engineer and Open Source Evangelist

Talks should focus on operationalizing AI/ML workloads using open infrastructure, especially around LLM serving, distributed training, vector databases, and edge inferencing in resource-constrained environments.

**Armstrong Foundjem**

École Polytechnique Montréal | Research Scientist in AI

I would like to see submissions that explore how AI and ML can enhance the resilience, scalability, and sustainability of open infrastructure. This includes intelligent automation for CI/CD workflows, energy-aware scheduling, AI-driven observability, and explainable ML systems for DevSecOps. I also encourage talks on federated learning, agent-based orchestration, and real-world integrations of AI in OpenStack, Kubernetes, and edge computing environments.

**Goutham Pacha Ravi**

Red Hat | Principal Software Engineer and OpenStack Technical Committee Chair

I'd like to see submissions experimenting with Open Source AI, model training and use of OpenStack with commodity and purpose-built hardware integrations. I'd like to see benchmarking and OpenStack showcased within research and academic AI fields.

**Qihui Zhao**

China Mobile Research Institute 

AI infrastructure management by OpenStack, Kubernetes.
