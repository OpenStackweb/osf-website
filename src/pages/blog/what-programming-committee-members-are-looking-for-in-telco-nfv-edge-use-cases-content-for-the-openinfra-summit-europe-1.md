We’re excited for the upcoming OpenInfra Summit Europe and can’t wait to connect with the community! As we gear up for another dynamic gathering of developers, operators, and technologists, the Programming Committee for the **AI Infrastructure** track is looking for compelling, real-world sessions that highlight how open infrastructure is powering the future of AI.

If you're building scalable AI platforms, integrating open source tools to support ML workflows, or solving infrastructure challenges unique to AI and deep learning, we want to hear from you. Submit your proposal by **June 13** and join us in shaping the conversation around practical, open, and production-ready AI infrastructure.

## What We’re Looking For

Here’s the type of content the committee is excited to see:

* Operationalizing AI/ML workloads using open infrastructure, with a focus on:

  * LLM (Large Language Model) serving
  * Distributed training
  * Vector databases
  * Edge inferencing in resource-constrained environments
* Enhancing the resilience, scalability, and sustainability of AI infrastructure through:

  * Intelligent automation for CI/CD workflows
  * Energy-aware scheduling
  * AI-driven observability
  * Explainable ML systems for DevSecOps
* Federated learning and agent-based orchestration for AI infrastructure
* Real-world integrations of AI in OpenStack, Kubernetes, and edge computing environments
* Experimentation with Open Source AI tools and frameworks
* Model training and inference on OpenStack with both commodity and purpose-built hardware
* Benchmarking AI/ML workloads on OpenStack
* Showcasing OpenStack in academic and research AI use cases
