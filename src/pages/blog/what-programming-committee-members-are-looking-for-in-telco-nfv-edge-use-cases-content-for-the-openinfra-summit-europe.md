We’re excited to welcome you to the upcoming **[OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/)**! This year’s **Telco, NFV & Edge use cases** track highlights the cutting-edge innovations and real-world deployments shaping the future of telecommunications and edge computing. Whether you’re driving network function virtualization (NFV), deploying cloud-native telco infrastructure, or enabling edge computing use cases—from 5G to IoT—this track will showcase practical solutions, architectural insights, and operational best practices.

We’re looking for session proposals that explore how open infrastructure technologies are transforming telco networks and edge environments—covering topics such as network automation, distributed cloud, edge application frameworks, service orchestration, and open standards. If you have hands-on experience, case studies, or visionary ideas on accelerating telco and edge innovation through open source, your contributions will help advance this rapidly evolving ecosystem.

**[Submit your session proposals by June 13](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/cfp/)** and join us in driving the future of connected infrastructure that powers modern networks and edge services.

## What We’re Looking For

* **Operational challenges and solutions**: real-world issues, fixes, troubleshooting, and best practices from operators working in telco, NFV, and edge environments.
* **Large scale deployments**: lessons learned and strategies for managing and scaling open infrastructure in telco and public cloud settings.
* **Stories from the trenches**: practical experiences with clear, impactful lessons that help others save time and money.
* **Pragmatic development directions**: suggestions and visions for the evolution of open infrastructure projects based on proven market demand, not hype.
* **Network automation, orchestration, and monitoring** in operational contexts.
* **Performance optimization and reliability at scale**.
* **Edge use cases with operational focus**, including 5G, IoT, and distributed cloud.
* **Interoperability and standards adoption** in production environments.
