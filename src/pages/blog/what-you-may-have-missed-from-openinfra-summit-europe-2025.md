"Ultimately, what makes us resilient is not technology. It is working together, beyond borders, despite political leaders. What makes us reliant is our community," said Thierry Carrez, general manager at the OpenInfra Foundation, to kick off the [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) during Friday's keynotes. After over ten years, the OpenInfra Foundation returned to Paris for the OpenInfra Summit Europe, gathering the global OpenInfra community to celebrate its contributions to human progress and collaborate on building the next decade of open infrastructure solutions.

Over 1,200 attendees from 65+ countries gathered at France's most prestigious engineering university, École Polytechnique. The OpenInfra Summit week was full of exciting announcements and new (and growing!) users sharing their open source, production use cases. Special thanks to the [support of the sponsors](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/sponsor/), who made the event possible:

* **Headline Sponsor:** OVHcloud
* **Premier Sponsors:** Canonical, Huawei, Mirantis
* **Spotlight Sponsors:** Open Telekom Cloud, StackIT, Storware, ZConverter
* **Exhibitor Sponsors:** Clastix, D-Stack, edgeContinuum, GerritForge, Red Hat, Sardina Systems, StackHPC, Worteks
* **Supporting Sponsors:** Cloud&Heat, CloudFerro, Menzel IT
* **OpenStack Birthday Sponsor:** Cachengo

### **Keynotes Highlight Power of Open Source Resilience** 

OpenInfra Summit keynote speakers emphasized the power of the open source model—companies collaboratively building software to drive innovation, magnify their return on investment, and make a positive impact on the world. 

* OpenInfra Members (Canonical, Rackspace Technology, Worteks, Red Hat, and ZConverter) [executed five simultaneous demos](https://youtu.be/slOxTkVEiSE?si=fs8oIV15NCfWafm9) migrating a workload from VMware to OpenStack. The successful demos highlight the breadth of OpenStack-powered alternatives for organizations reeling from Broadcom pricing increases.
*  Zvonko Kaiser from NVIDIA and [Xu Wang from Ant Open Source](https://youtu.be/QxUJjg04ipc?si=u6B7hJIpxs9CnPWe) highlighted Kata Containers' ability to secure AI workloads
* A [new, community-developed OpenStack for AI white paper](https://openstack.org/openstack-for-ai) was published, highlighting the features behind OpenStack that support AI workloads as well as several production reference architectures. Kendall Nelson, OpenInfra Foundation senior upstream developer advocate, and Stig Telfer, StackHPC CTO, discussed this community-wide collaboration in this [TFIR podcast](https://tfir.io/openinfra-ai-infrastructure/).
* OpenInfra Foundation executive director Jonathan Bryce and OVHcloud founder and CEO, Octave Klaba discussed how [OVH has built their open source powered resilience](https://youtu.be/n3SKNXH3hTI?si=BvhTPKNE49xn-X28).
* The latest innovations in weather forecasting and telco workloads from [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://youtu.be/ban-qA-F814?si=cS3EI8PLdTA3l5W7) and [BT Group](https://youtu.be/RPNsT5W1zfY?si=5axyOu1F635MqHxY) supported by the OpenInfra Blueprint
* [StackHPC was recognized](https://youtu.be/9ITY0tF3cpA?si=wRXzwI9_ttCq9K2y) as the newest Superuser Awards winner
* [Over 100 upstream contributors were recognized onstage](https://youtu.be/uC3kiJWZ0b8?si=2i56efEC0zEhu1SD), representing a sample of the thousands of contributors who make OpenInfra innovation possible.

### **Co-Located Events Enable Cross-Community Collaboration** 

Co-located with the OpenInfra Summit for the first time, the [Gerrit User Summit](https://gitenterprise.me/2025/10/22/how-git-and-gerrit-are-re-tooling-for-the-age-of-ai/) generated considerable enthusiasm and valuable discussion. The organizers were particularly excited to welcome members of the broader Git ecosystem, including Patrick Steinhart from GitLab, Scott Chacon from GitButler and Skyler for the JJ project. As a result of the 2025 Gerrit User Summit, the Git and Gerrit communities are unified, energized, and actively building the next generation of source code management.

Building upon the market's response to Broadcom changing VMware licenses two years ago, the OpenInfra Foundation also hosted a VM Migration Day to discuss the various perspectives of virtualization migration. The day-long event covered the executive and business angles through a Q&A with Cleura's Johan Christenson and Forrester's Naveen Chhabra,  feature comparisons between OpenStack and VMware from OpenStack TC member Dmitry Rabotjagov, and storage considerations from Ceph Foundation board member and Clyso CTO Dan van der Ster. Kendall Nelson then moderated a series of lightning demos, further highlighting the OpenStack-powered products and migration options.

In addition to these co-located events, the Open Source Pavilion located in the OpenInfra Marketplace, offered attendees the opportunities to network with various open source teams to learn about their efforts and how to get involved. Participating groups included the OpenInfra i18n SIG, Inclusion Working Group, Kata Containers, Zuul, OpenStack TC, Scientific SiG,  as well as more open source communities including Ceph, SCS, ALASCA, and Krateo Platform Ops.

#### OpenInfra Project Development, Adoption Span 100+ Breakout Sessions

Across workshops, breakout sessions and Forum discussions, attendees were able to learn about the latest innovations around OpenInfra and adjacent open source technologies. Highlights include:

* [BMW](https://youtu.be/Z8rofKRen3w?si=GNt16QGeJnboXJnx) and [Workday](https://youtu.be/VnZQE8RpYCY?si=_qgWiVkStcug88Vh) shared how Zuul (OpenInfra’s CI/CD gating system) helps prevent breakages before code lands, directly improving uptime and change velocity at scale.
* Over 20 sessions highlighted the [deployment of the OpenInfra Blueprint](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule/#view=calendar&tags=4857), the open source architectural standard of combining Linux, OpenStack, and Kubernetes.
* Digital sovereignty, one of the most discussed topics in Europe throughout the event, was examined through an open source lens, further highlighting the need for community-wide collaboration.
