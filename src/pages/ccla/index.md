Open Infrastructure Foundation projects use the Apache-2 license with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

Corporations that sign the [CCLA](https://openstack.na1.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=56JUVGT95E78X5) submit the initial list of employees authorized to commit code to OpenInfra projects using Schedule A of the CCLA.

To update the list of authorized employees, please fill and sign the [Updated Schedule A](https://openstack.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=56JUVP6K4Z6P4C) module providing the actual list of employees.

Please do not provide only the changes, provide the full list current with all additions/removals.

If you need help, please contact [ecosystem@openinfra.dev](ecosystem@openinfra.dev).
