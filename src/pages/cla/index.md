In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Open Infrastructure Foundation projects use the Apache-2 license with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), in a way comparable to Apache Foundation projects.

#### About the CCLA: Corporate Contributor License Agreement

- Corporations sign the [CCLA](https://openstack.na1.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=56JUVGT95E78X5) and submit the initial list of employees authorized to commit code to OpenInfra projects using Schedule A of the CCLA.
- To update the list of authorized employees, please fill and sign the [Updated Schedule A](https://openstack.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=56JUVP6K4Z6P4C)module providing the actual list of employees.
  - Please do not provide only the changes, provide the full list current with all additions/removals.
- Contributions by United States Government personnel acting in their official capacity need a specific CLA. Please contact [ecosystem@openinfra.dev](mailto:ecosystem@openinfra.dev) for more information.

#### About the iCLA: Individual Contributor License Agreement

- In addition to the Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA), individual contributors must agree to the [Individual Contributor License Agreement (iCLA)](https://review.opendev.org/static/cla.html).
- You can [follow these instructions](https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/setup-gerrit.html#individual-contributor-license-agreement) to to complete the Individual Contributor License Agreement (iCLA).
- You will not be able to push patches to Gerrit without completing the iCLA.
