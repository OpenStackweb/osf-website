In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, Open Infrastructure Foundation projects use the Apache License, Version 2.0 with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), in a way comparable to Apache Foundation projects.

#### Contributing on behalf of a company or organization

- Corporations sign the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://openstack.na1.echosign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhDTAMq6kgSf2UdgX9jC5CunsY_C0R-X3vHFJFCKdM4DPQOuok5yutkKOlIFXMHDiW8*) (CCLA) and submit the initial list of employees authorized to commit code to OpenInfra projects using Schedule A of the CCLA.
- To update the list of authorized employees, please fill and sign the [Updated Schedule A](https://openstack.na1.echosign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhAvE484IFkdlIg0ymoEWqQnfFfRkEl4TyggI0pKr0a3KvH99UavR52q22fXWoj3pwM*) module providing the actual list of employees. Please do not provide only the changes, provide the full list current with all additions/removals.
- In addition to their organization submitting the CCLA, individual contributors must agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA). This is done by clicking the **New Contributor Agreement** link in their [Gerrit account settings](https://review.opendev.org/settings/#Agreements).
- Contributions by United States Government personnel acting in their official capacity need a specific CLA. Please contact [ecosystem@openinfra.dev](mailto:ecosystem@openinfra.dev) for more information.

#### Individuals contributing on their behalf

- Individual contributors must agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA). This is done by clicking the New Contributor Agreement link in their [Gerrit account settings](https://review.opendev.org/settings/#Agreements).
- OpenStack contributors can find more details on how to set up their Gerrit account on the [OpenStack Contributor guide](https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/setup-gerrit.html).
- Please note that you will not be able to propose changes to Gerrit without signing the ICLA. You can preview the terms of the ICLA [here](https://review.opendev.org/static/cla.html).
