introduction: "Organizations have turned to the cloud to increase operational
  efficiency while decreasing costs. Recent studies have shown that these same
  organizations are turning to hybrid cloud infrastructure powered by a mixture
  of open source technologies for additional flexibility around workload
  repatriation. Within production hybrid clouds, OpenInfra technologies provide
  container security, edge nodes, CI/CD, secure private clouds and the largest
  footprint of public cloud data centers in the world.  "
