      Modern apps rely on automated infrastructure, from massive data center
      clouds to the smallest edge  nodes for IoT and 5G, and none of it is
      possible without open source software. This is Open  Infrastructure: open
      source technologies enabling everyone to provide infrastructure for
      others  to build solutions on.

      OpenInfra Foundation and its 110,000 members from 187 countries exist to ensure each open source component is  built and tested together, collaboratively, with a radical approach to openness we call the  Four Opens: Open Source, Development, Design and Community.

      From Community, where anyone is welcome to contribute; to Design, where diverse ideas are shared  before the coding begins; to Development, when every patch is visible and tested before it lands;  to the Source code itself, which is shared with the world: each is critical to how we deliver  open source.

      It works. OpenStack has proven the model, becoming one of the 3 most
      actively developed open  source projects on the planet, with thousands of
      developers from over 180 countries. And it  powers everything from
      massively popular games like Overwatch™ to the largest power company  in
      the world in China, to Workday, to ATT's 5G networks and beyond.

      Now we're ready to share this radically open method for developing open source software with  the world beyond OpenStack, helping people build and operate open infrastructure.

    The world has changed. When OpenStack started in 2010, clouds were mainly in
    virtual machines in  a datacenter. Today, clouds have evolved to work
    seamlessly in and out of datacenters and are  composed of an evolving mix of
    bare metal, VMs, and containers. While OpenStack is seen as the  de-facto
    open source platform for operating cloud infrastructure around the world,
    more technology  is needed to meet all of the diverse use cases, and we want
    to make sure it’s developed in the  open, using the same proven approach to
    open source.

    For this reason, we have expanded our focus as a foundation and are helping to establish new open  source communities to advance areas where technology can successfully contribute to the development  of open infrastructure: AI/Machine Learning, CI/CD, Container Infrastructure, Edge Computing and  of course, Public, Private and Hybrid Clouds.

  text: Staying true to our mission of helping people build and operate open
    infrastructure, OpenInfra Foundation hosts  open source projects that
    contribute to the advancement of today’s infrastructure. From cloud  hosting
    to the driving force behind 5G, these projects are code first and operate
    under the guiding  principles we call the “Four Opens”.
