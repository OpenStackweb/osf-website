      There are two levels of accounts on OpenStack.org: "Community Member" and "Foundation Member". The Foundation 
      Member level has additional rights but also substantial responsibilities as a member of the OpenStack Foundation. 
      Here's a quick summary of the differences:
    note: >-
      Foundation Members are required to vote regularly in Board elections, or their membership can be suspended. Note 
      that new Foundation Members must be members for 180 days before they are elligible to vote in Board Member 
      elections. Inactive Foundation Member accounts are moved to Community Member level automatically after a period 
      of inactivity. You may also log into your profile at any time and adjust your membership level.
