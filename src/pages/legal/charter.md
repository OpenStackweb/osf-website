1\. **Mission and Scope of the OpenInfra Foundation.**

  a) The mission of the OpenInfra Foundation, a directed fund of the Linux Foundation (the "Directed Fund") is to facilitate the building and operation of open infrastructure. To enable that mission, the purpose of the Directed Fund is to raise, budget and spend funds in support of various open source, open data and/or open standards projects relating to operating cloud infrastructure, including infrastructure and support initiatives related thereto (each such project, a "Technical Project"). The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project.

  b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the "Governing Board") and The Linux Foundation (the "LF") as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation's tax-exempt status.

  c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund may also have working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, "Committees") that are established by the Governing Board. These Committees report to the Governing Board.

2\. **Membership.**

  a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Gold, Silver and Associate Members (each a "Member" and, collectively, the "Members") in Good Standing. All Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as a Member. All participating Members of the Directed Fund enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all Members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the Governing Board may adopt with notice to Members.

  b) Each Platinum Member will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board (each such representative, a "Platinum Representative") and any Committee. The number of Platinum Members shall be defined as the "Representative Limit". The Representative Limit will change from time to time when the number of Platinum Members changes. Each Platinum Member may at any time and from time to time remove without cause and replace its Platinum Representative and any representative of such Platinum Member to any Committee. The term of each Platinum Representative shall continue until the death, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of the Platinum Representative by the Platinum Member that appointed the Platinum Representative or the termination of the membership of the Platinum Member that appointed such Platinum Representative.

  c) The Gold Members will, annually as a class, elect the same number of representatives to the Governing Board (each such representative, a "Gold Representative") as the Representative Limit; provided, that in the event that the Representative Limit is reduced or increased due to a decrease or increase in the number of Platinum Members during the course of the calendar year, the term of any incumbent Gold Representative shall not be shortened thereby and the corresponding reduction or increase in the total number of Gold Representatives shall not occur until the next annual election. In the case of the death, resignation, removal or other vacancy of any individual Gold Representative, the Gold Member that appointed such Gold Representative may designate a replacement for the balance of such individual Gold Representative's term.

  d) The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members of The Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for joining the Directed Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member.

  e) The Governing Board will maintain an OIF Individual Member participation program (the "OIF Individual Member Program") for individuals who contribute to or support any Technical Project or participate in any activity of the OpenInfra Foundation (each such individual who has joined the OIF Individual Member Program, an "OIF Individual Member"). OIF Individual Members are not Members of the Directed Fund but receive those benefits as specified herein, in the OIF Individual Member Program and in the Trademark Policy. During the term of their membership, all OIF Individual Members will comply with all such policies as the Governing Board may adopt with notice to OIF Individual Members.

  f) OIF Individual Members will, annually as a class, elect the same number of representatives to the Governing Board (each such representative, an "OIF Individual Member Representative") as the Representative Limit; provided, that in the event that the Representative Limit is reduced or increased due to a decrease or increase in the number of Platinum Members during the course of the calendar year, the term of any incumbent OIF Individual Member Representative shall not be shortened thereby and the corresponding reduction or increase in the total number of OIF Individual Member Representatives shall not occur until the next election. In the case of the death, resignation, removal or other vacancy of any OIF Individual Representative, the vacancy may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining OIF Individual Representatives.

  g) Procedures for elections of Gold Representatives and OIF Individual Member Representatives, as well as eligibility requirements for nominees for OIF Individual Member Representatives, will be documented under an Election Procedures Policy which will be maintained on the web site of the Directed Fund.

  h) Members will be entitled to:

    i) participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, elections or appointments (as applicable), events and any other activities; and

    ii) identify themselves as members of the OpenInfra Foundation supporting the OpenInfra Foundation community, as described in the Trademark Policy (as defined in Section 7, below).

  b) Each Voting Representative will have one vote on each matter submitted for a vote.

  c) Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus.

Except as provided in Section 12.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

  c) If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source project, membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member will extend only to the employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.

  d) Directed Fund Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except that a Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor to substantially all of its business or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and policies required by LF membership.

6\. **Good Standing.**
