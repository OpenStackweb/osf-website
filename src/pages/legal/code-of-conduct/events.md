The OpenInfra Foundation is dedicated to providing an inclusive and safe Summit experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Summit participants in any form.

We are a diverse community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Please be considerate and careful with your words and actions. Do not insult or put down other participants.

Please review the [OpenInfra Community Code of Conduct](/legal/code-of-conduct), which applies to all events and community forums, including the Open Infrastructure Summit.

Of special interest to OpenDev + PTG, exhibitors in the expo hall, evening party hosts and organizers of related Summit activities should be aware they are also subject to the code of conduct. In particular, exhibitors and party hosts should not promote sexualized or offensive imagery or activities. Booth and party staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant or sponsor engages in behavior that violates the community code of conduct, the OpenInfra Foundation staff may take action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Summit with no refund.

##### What Constitutes Harassment

- Violent threats, intimidation or personal insults directed against another person
- Verbal, graphic or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Stalking or following, including harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other presentations
- Inappropriate physical contact or sexual attention
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

##### Report Harassment

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please find a member of the Summit staff at the registration desk or wearing Staff t-shirts, or contact the OpenInfra Foundation staff immediately via phone or email.

##### OpenInfra Foundation Staff contact information

- **Jonathan Bryce**, [jonathan@openinfra.dev](mailto:jonathan@openinfra.dev), cell # +1-210-317-2438

- **Allison Price**, [allison@openinfra.dev](mailto:allison@openinfra.dev), cell # +1-214-686-6821

##### Process to file complaint

- Please report offensive behavior or incidents immediately to Event Staff or Foundation staff:
  - Event staff can be found at the registration desk, info booths or identified by wearing Staff shirts, or
  - Foundation staff can be contacted by phone or email listed above
- Please be prepared to provide as much of the following information as possible about the behavior or incident:
  - Whether or not there is immediate or physical danger
  - Identifying/contact information of the person doing the harassing
  - Contact information of the person who felt violated
  - The behavior that was in violation, approximate time and circumstances
  - Other people involved in the incident
  - Whether or not you would prefer to have your complaint be kept anonymous in the situation
  - Staff will notify offender of complaint, determine appropriate penalty and communicate the resolution
- Best Practices:
  - Do not feel the need to engage directly or further with the offender, the Staff is there to support you or bring in additional resources.
  - If you feel your safety is in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement.
  - When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

##### OpenInfra Foundation staff response procedure:

- OpenInfra Foundation and on-site event staff are well-informed of community code of conduct and response procedures.
- Staff will gather details of the complaint to make an initial report, including:
  - Whether or not there is immediate or physical danger, in which case staff should contact local authorities
  - Identifying information of the participant doing the harassing
  - The behavior that was in violation, approximate time and circumstances
  - Other people involved in the incident
  - Whether or not the reporting party prefers to remain anonymous
  - Staff will try to get as much of the incident in written form by the reporter, or will otherwise transcribe the incident as it was told to them.
- Staff will make an initial response to the complainant:
  - Do they need help?
  - Do they need to be connected with a safe person, friend or family member?
  - Do they need a safe space?
- Staff will make the complainant aware of the response procedure and next steps to feel confident action is being taken, but avoid the following:
  - Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
  - Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility
  - Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility
- After taking any initial action required to care for the complainant, staff will notify Foundation Executive Director, who will determine:
  - If there is a need to bring in legal counsel, authorities or additional resources
  - If public communications are required in the case of a public incident
  - If additional information gathering is required from witnesses, staff or other parties
  - Staff or Executive Director will notify accused of complaint and allow for response before applying any penalty. In the meantime, accused should not have any contact with complainant.
- Following the conversation, staff will convene to consider appropriate action, which may include:
  - Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions
  - Requiring the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim
  - Ending a talk early that violates the policy, or choosing not to publish the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
  - Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give further talks at this or future events
  - Ending any volunteer responsibilities or privileges the harasser holds (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
  - Requiring that the harasser immediately leave an event and not return
  - Banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
  - Removing the harasser from membership of the Foundation and community roles and responsibilities
- Staff will then inform the accused of what action, if any, will be taken against them.
- Staff will then inform complainant (and any witnesses if appropriate) of the resolution, and record the outcome.
