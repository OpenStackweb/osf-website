##### Want to throw an OpenInfra Day, OpenStack Day or event?

We're excited you want to bring the community together and help spread the word. Community members often help organize events, including local user group meetups. "OpenInfra Days" and "OpenStack Days," to share knowledge, network and help drive adoption.

We have varying rules for the logo and wordmark usage depending on the type of event, primarily to ensure the OpenStack brand is used for community building purposes on a level playing field.

##### User Groups & Meetups

User Groups help facilitate communication among regional communities by organizing regular meetups or mailing list communications. They are an important part of OpenStack culture and exist all over the world. In order for a user group to make use of the OpenStack name and logo, please [email us to become an official user group](mailto:community@openinfra.dev).

##### OpenInfra and OpenStack Days

OpenInfra Days and OpenStack Days are larger conference-style events that typically happen once per year in a particular region. They range in scale and duration, but are often one or two-day events organized by local user groups, and attract speakers from all over the world. They have a higher level of production and recruit several sponsors to cover the costs.

In order to throw an "OpenInfra Day" or "OpenStack Day" and use the OpenInfra Day or OpenStack Day name and logo, you need to obtain permission from the OpenStack Foundation d/b/a Open Infrastructure Foundation by contacting [events@openstack.org](mailto:events@openstack.org). We will ask you to follow these guidelines to maintain the spirit of fairness and openness in the OpenInfra community:

- The purpose of the event must be to educate and inform, not to sell products and services.

- The intent of the event must NOT be to generate a profit. You may take in sponsorship dollars, but only to cover costs of the event.

- The event should be published and attendance should be open to the public, the only restrictions being venue capacity.

- Commercial participants should have equal opportunity to sponsor and support the activity. When the number of sponsorships is limited, a best practice is to publish a sponsorship prospectus online on a date known in advance with sponsorships filled on a "first to sign" basis.

- You are responsible for your own privacy policy governing your collection and use of attendeeâ€™s personal data. At a minimum, you may not make use of the attendee list for commercial or marketing purposes, only community-building activities, such as sharing event updates or scheduling future meetups. You may not sell the list or share with third parties who are not directly involved in organizing the event.

- Please include events@openstack.org as an administrator for any tools you use to organize your event, such as Meetup.com, Eventbrite, etc. so that the OpenInfra team can stay informed of all community events and help the organizers when needed.

- Because we host a global Open Infrastructure Summit, refrain from using "Summit" in your event title to avoid confusion.

- Finally, the OpenStack brand should be used properly, according the the guidelines - http://openstack.org/brand/
