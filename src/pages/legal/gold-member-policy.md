If the breach is not cured within the period provided in the Gold Member Agreement, the Board of Directors shall vote on termination of the Gold Member by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the termination of the Gold Member, the Secretary shall give written notice to the Gold Member.

(c) If a Gold Member which is a business entity becomes Controlled by another Gold Member or Platinum Member, such Gold Member (“Controlled Gold Member”) shall cease to be a Gold Member on the closing date of the transaction which results in the Gold Member becoming a Controlled Gold Member.

3. Nomination and Election of New Gold Members. If an existing Gold Member does not give written notice of renewal as provided in Section 1(c), resigns from the Foundation as provided in Section 2, is combined with another Platinum Member or Corporate Gold Member as provided in Section 2 or is terminated as provided in Section 2, the Secretary shall promptly give notice of such event to all Members and provide a notice on the website of the Foundation. Any entity may nominate itself to be a new potential Gold Member using the following procedure. Any proposed new Gold Member may not be Affiliated with an existing Platinum Member or existing Gold Member on the date of its application. The nomination must be in writing to the Secretary with the information determined by the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall promptly provide a copy of such nomination to all of the other remaining Members and members of the Board of Directors. The nominee must execute the Gold Member Agreement and submit it to the Secretary.

4. List of Gold Members. The Secretary shall publish the list of the names of the Gold Members but without their contact information. Upon a written request by a Voting Class Member for the purposes permitted by Delaware Corporate Law, the Secretary shall make available the contact information of all Gold Members solely for the purposes permitted under Delaware Corporate Law and shall be treated as confidential.
