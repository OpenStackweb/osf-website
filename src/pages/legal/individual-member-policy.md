#### Appendix 1

### Individual Member Policy

1. Procedures for Admission of Individual Members. Persons who wish to become Individual Members shall apply to the Secretary and provide the information established from time to time by the Board. At a minimum, the application shall include the name of the person, employer, his Affiliations as defined in the Bylaws, statement of interest in the purposes of the Foundation and contact information. After review of the application and execution of an Individual Member Agreement by the applicant, the Executive Director or its designee shall admit the person as an Individual Member and the Secretary shall add the person to the Individual Member Registry. The effective date of membership for an Individual Member shall be the date on which the person is added to the Individual Member Registry.

2. Resignation by Individual Members. Individual Members may resign by giving written notice to the Secretary and the Secretary or another officer designated by the Executive Director will promptly remove the person from the Individual Member Registry. The effective date of termination of the Individual Member shall be the date of removal from the Individual Member Registry.

3. Termination of Individual Members. The Secretary and the Executive Director, acting together, may, or the Board of Directors may direct the Secretary and Executive Director to, terminate an Individual Member as follows: (i) for violation of the Individual Member Agreement if the violation is not cured within the period provided in the Individual Member Agreement, (ii) for violation of the Community Code of Conduct, or (iii) failure to vote in at least 50% of the votes for Individual Members within the prior twenty-four months unless the person does not respond within thirty (30) days of notice of such termination that the person wishes to continue to be an Individual Member. Upon termination as provided above, the Secretary or another officer designated by the Executive Director shall promptly remove the person from the Individual Member Registry. The effective date of termination of the Individual Member shall be the date of removal from the Individual Member Registry.

4. Individual Member Registry. The Secretary shall publish the list of the names of the Individual Members but without their contact information. Upon a written request by an Individual Member, Platinum Member or Gold Member for the purposes permitted by Delaware Corporate Law, the Secretary shall make available the contact information of all Individual Members solely for the purposes permitted under Delaware Corporate Law, provided that the Secretary may require the information to be treated as confidential information by the recipient to the extent permitted by Delaware law.
