This Trademark Policy (the "Trademark Policy"), prepared by the OpenStack Foundation (hereinafter referred to as "OpenStack Foundation"), sets out rules for proper use of the mark "OpenStack" (hereinafter referred to as "the OpenStack Word Mark") and the "OpenStack Logo" or "OpenStack Logos" (as defined in Section 6 of the Trademark Policy) when referring to the OpenStack project and code base. The OpenStack Word Mark, the OpenStack Logos and all OpenStack trademarks (hereinafter referred to individually as an "OpenStack Mark" or collectively as "OpenStack Marks") are trademarks of the OpenStack Foundation.

A list of OpenStack Marks may be found by clicking here. The OpenStack Foundation may update this list from time to time and without prior notice, so we recommend that you refer to the OpenStack Trademark List on a regular basis.

This Trademark Policy applies to all uses of the OpenStack Marks (in word and logo form).

##### Objective and scope of the OpenStack® Trademark Policy

The objective of this Trademark Policy is to ensure that the OpenStack Marks remain reliable indicators of source and quality and that they are protected from inappropriate and unauthorized use. The Trademark Policy explains when and how you may use the OpenStack Marks without our written authorization, when the OpenStack Foundation's written permission is required, and what the OpenStack Foundation considers to be unauthorized use of the OpenStack Marks.

The OpenStack Foundation reserves the right to review all usage of the OpenStack Marks within the open source community and to terminate use of the Marks by any party for non-compliance with this Trademark Policy or written authorization. The OpenStack Foundation may change this Trademark Policy at its sole discretion at any time effective immediately unless your license agreement states that the changes will become effective at a later time.

##### Authorized use of OpenStack® Trademarks

**General**

AS A GENERAL RULE, THE OPENSTACK MARKS MAY NOT BE USED IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT OR AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THIS TRADEMARK POLICY.

You must use an OpenStack Mark in accordance with this Policy and the applicable license agreement. To the extent any part of the Trademark Policy conflicts or is inconsistent with any part of a written agreement between you and the OpenStack Foundation the written agreement shall control. No other rights of any kind are granted hereunder by implication or otherwise.

You will need written permission from us to use the OpenStack Marks: (i) for any commercial use, including but not limited to merchandising purposes (e.g. T-shirts, mugs); (ii) for use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top of a product supplied by the OpenStack Foundation; (iii) for use of a Restricted Use Logo; or (iv) for use in an attention-getting or branding manner. Without the express prior written consent of the OpenStack Foundation, no OpenStack Marks may be used in a manner that implies an affiliation with, approval by, endorsement of or sponsorship by the OpenStack Foundation.

**OPENSTACK WORD MARK**

We share the OpenStack Word Mark with the community for the purposes of open source discussion, development and support of the OpenStack project and technology. We understand that such use is mostly for non-commercial purposes and therefore we will allow the use of the OpenStack Word Mark, without a license, when used in a referential phrase only to describe the OpenStack Project or the OpenStack code base, provided you comply with the following requirements:

The OpenStack Word Mark is used in a manner consistent with this Trademark Policy and usage guidelines below;

There is no commercial activity associated with the use of the OpenStack Word Mark, except as may be permitted in a written license from the OpenStack Foundation;

The OpenStack Word Mark is used only to refer to the OpenStack project and/or technology; and

The OpenStack Word Mark is not used in an attention-getting or branding manner, or used as part of your product or service name, unless you have met the requirements specified in the Section Restricted Use that Requires a Trademark License Prior to Use and further detailed in the Restricted Use Logo Guidelines available by clicking here, and have agreed to the terms of the applicable OpenStack Trademark License Agreement.

The OpenStack Word Mark appears less prominent than your company or product name.

The reference to OpenStack does not create a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or false association with the OpenStack Foundation.

ALL OTHER USES OF THE OPENSTACK WORD MARK REQUIRE A WRITTEN LICENSE AGREEMENT.

**OPENSTACK LOGOS**

The OpenStack Logos may not be used without prior written authorization from the OpenStack Foundation.

**OpenStack Community**

You may use the OpenStack logo available here for community building activities, provided these activities and uses are not commercial in nature. Such community building activities include presentations at open source conferences, activities promoting the OpenStack project, or collateral for promoting and organizing an OpenStack meetup. You may also use the OpenStack logo for referential purposes. For example, when you are referring to the OpenStack cloud or OpenStack project in your presentations. When using the logo for referential purposes you may not use the logo in a trademark sense (as part of your product/company name and/or logo), your company logo must be more prominently displayed, you may only use the OpenStack logo as much as it is necessary to identify the OpenStack product, you do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by OpenStack, and you use the OpenStack trademark notice. In all cases, you must follow the guidelines in this Policy and the Community Logo Use Guidelines. For all other uses, you must have a trademark license to use an OpenStack Logo unless the logo is part of a Web Badge authorized for use by this Trademark Policy.

**OpenStack Web Badges**

We prepared a family of "OpenStack Web Badges" that may be used without specific written permission to show support of the OpenStack project. (See Section Linking to the OpenStack Website below).

**Restricted Use OpenStack Logos**

We also prepared a set of specific "restricted use" OpenStack Logos and Word Marks that may be used only by OpenStack licensees. The OpenStack Trademark License will include stringent use guidelines and additional conditions including but not limited to those specified below. See Section Restricted Use that Requires a Trademark License Prior to Use.

**PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS**

Third parties may use the OpenStack Word Mark in publications, such as books or magazines, or in connection with the presentations and publications that are displayed to the public (collectively, "Publications"), provided that:

Such use is referential only: you are simply referring to the OpenStack project and not speaking for the OpenStack project or community.

The OpenStack Word Mark is not used to promote your own products and services.

The OpenStack Word Mark is not used in an attention-getting or branding manner.

Your name or mark and logo shall appear in a prominent location on the cover or the title page of the Publication and shall be featured with greater prominence than the OpenStack Word Mark.

You do not apply to register or register any term comprised or consisting of in whole or in part the OpenStack Word Mark or any confusingly similar mark as trademarks, service marks, corporate names, trade names or domain names, Internet keywords, metatags, or trigger words to lead to a website or other Internet destination.

You comply with this Trademark Policy and usage guidelines.

You attribute the OpenStack marks with the proper symbol and footnote it on all Publications as explained below.

No written permission is needed from the OpenStack Foundation to use the OpenStack Word Mark in this limited manner in connection with Publications. However, OpenStack Logos may be used only with the OpenStack Foundation's prior written permission.
