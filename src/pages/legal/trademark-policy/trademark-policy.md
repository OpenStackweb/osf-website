# Trademark Policy

We're excited that you want to help promote OpenInfra and OpenInfra open source projects by using trademarks/brands connected with OpenStack Foundation d/b/a Open Infrastructure Foundation (“OpenInfra").  No matter how you contribute in one of the following categories, your help spreading the word about OpenInfra and its projects is extremely valuable: you may be an individual or organization who wishes to show your support for OpenInfra or its projects; you may be a member of OpenInfra who wishes to display indicia of your membership or brand a commercial product; you may be an organizer of “Days” or “User Group” activities for OpenInfra or its projects, who wishes to promote community engagement; or you may be an individual who holds a credential/certification issued by OpenInfra that you want to showcase. This Trademark Policy (“Policy”) is designed to get you the resources you need and provide simple instructions for permitted use of the trademarks shown in the tables below and the word marks therein (collectively “Marks”), while highlighting those Marks that require membership and/or a license before they can be used, or are reserved for use only by OpenInfra.

Although the code produced by OpenInfra projects is freely available to you under open source software licenses, your ability to use the Marks is restricted under trademark law. It is important that we protect and enforce our trademark rights to ensure Marks remain reliable indicators of source, quality and association with OpenInfra.  By keeping the Marks strong, we are better able to police bad actors who misrepresent their products, services or sponsorships as sanctioned or endorsed by OpenInfra.

To get started, please review the Policy, which applies on a global basis. Then, it's just a matter of selecting the right category of Marks for your needs, from those available to everyone, those available to members, those available to organizers of “Days” or “User Group” activities, or those available to individuals who hold a credential/certification. If you are looking for any additional information or access to an available license, please contact logo@openinfra.dev.  Note, the word “you” in the Policy means any party using the Marks.

## Rules that Apply to All Marks

You may only use the Marks as expressly permitted by this Policy or a separate signed, written agreement with OpenInfra, subject to one exception: nominative fair use.  For purposes of this Policy, “nominative fair use” means that you use a mark to refer to OpenInfra or its projects and do so because there is a real need to identify OpenInfra or a product or service of OpenInfra, you do not use the mark more than is necessary (e.g., you do not use the mark too prominently or too often, in terms of size, emphasis or repetition; and your own branding is more prominent in size and placement), and you do nothing to falsely suggest a connection with or endorsement by OpenInfra (e.g., by suggesting affiliation with, approval by or sponsorship of your product by OpenInfra).  You may not use the Marks in a way that implies affiliation with, approval by, sponsorship by, or endorsement by OpenInfra, unless you have specific permission from OpenInfra to do so in a separate, signed written agreement.

By using the Marks, you agree to the following: (1) to use the Marks exactly as provided and updated by OpenInfra from time to time, with any “TM” or “®” symbol included; (2) not to use altered versions of the Marks, except for updated versions of the Marks provided by OpenInfra, or incorporate the Marks into your own marks; (3) not to use any mark that is confusingly similar to any of the Marks, as judged by OpenInfra, as either a trademark, service mark, collective membership mark, certification mark, trade or business name, domain name, or social media username or handle, keyword, hashtag or attention-getting symbol (collectively “Name”); (4) not to register or seek to register any of the Marks or a mark that is confusingly similar to the Marks, as judged by OpenInfra, as a Name; (5) not to use the Marks in the manner that is illegal, offensive or tarnishes or defames OpenInfra, as judged by OpenInfra; (6) not to claim you own any rights in the Marks; (7) not to sublicense the Marks to others; (8) that OpenInfra owns exclusive rights in the Marks; (9) that any goodwill created when you use the Marks inures to the sole benefit of OpenInfra, its successors and assigns; (10) that the Marks are not descriptive or generic; (11) not to sue or threaten to sue OpenInfra for contributory infringement regarding activity by others that use the Marks; (12) to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless OpenInfra from third-party claims regarding your activities; and (13) not to challenge the rights of OpenInfra in the Marks, use of the Marks by OpenInfra or its licensees, or any application/registration for the Marks owned by OpenInfra.

OpenInfra reserves the right to terminate authorization to use the Marks if you fail to comply with this Policy or any signed, written agreement with OpenInfra, or for any other reason. OpenInfra may change this Policy in its sole discretion at any time, effective at the time of the change.  To the extent any part of the Policy conflicts with any part of a signed, written agreement with OpenInfra, that agreement shall control.

### For Organizations

#### *Preferred “Learn More About” Logos*

If your organization wishes to show your support for OpenInfra or the projects of OpenInfra in a way that is most helpful to OpenInfra, you may use the “Learn More About” logos in the table immediately below.  This use does not require a separate, signed written license, though it is subject to the following requirements: any logo used must link back to the corresponding website in the table below when a consumer clicks on the logo; the logos may not be used to brand a commercial product; and the marks may only be used to show support for OpenInfra and give consumers a way to learn more about OpenInfra by clicking on the logos, and not for any other purpose.

#### *Acceptable Standard Logos*

If your organization wishes to show your support for, or that it contributes to, OpenInfra or the projects of OpenInfra and does not wish to use the “Learn More About” logos, above, you may make nominative fair use of the logos in the table immediately below and the word marks therein (e.g., OPENSTACK).  This use does not require a separate, signed written license, though it is subject to the requirement that you do not use the mark to brand a commercial product and that you follow these nominative fair use requirements: (1) you use the mark to refer to OpenInfra or its projects and do so because there is a real need to identify OpenInfra or a product or service of OpenInfra; (2) you do not use the mark more than is necessary (e.g., you do not use the mark too prominently or too often, in terms of size, emphasis or repetition; and your own branding is more prominent in size and placement); and (3) you do nothing to falsely suggest a connection with or endorsement by OpenInfra (e.g., by suggesting affiliation with, approval by or sponsorship of your product by OpenInfra).  

Examples of nominative fair use include using one of these marks in a small way within a software architecture map or FAQ to show how OpenInfra software fits within the architecture, using one of the marks in an array of third-party logos where you make clear you support or contribute to the parties, or using one of the marks next to a statement indicating support for OpenInfra (e.g., “We love OpenStack”).  Examples of what is not nominative fair use include, making the mark the same size as or larger than your own mark, using one of these marks in a repetitive way, or using the mark without context that makes it clear the mark does not brand a commercial product but simply shows your support for, or that you contribute to, OpenInfra.
