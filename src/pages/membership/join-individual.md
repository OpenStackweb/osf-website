    days before they are eligible to vote in Governing Board Member elections.
    Inactive Individual Member accounts are transitioned to Community account
    level automatically if they do not vote in at least 50% of the Individual
    Member elections for which they were eligible within the prior 24-month

  text: >
    With a Community account, you still have the opportunity to participate in
    many of the OpenInfra Foundation's community activities, such as submitting
    and voting on proposed OpenInfra Summit talks. However, to run for
    leadership positions and vote in elections, you will need to upgrade your
    account to an Individual Member account (please see above). Get an
    OpenInfraID to participate in Community Events, without an Individual
    Membership.
