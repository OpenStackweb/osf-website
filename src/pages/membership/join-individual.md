    * Individual Members are required to vote regularly in Board elections, or their 
    membership will be transitioned to a Community account (please see below). Note 
    that new Foundation Members must be members for 180 days before they are eligible 
    to vote in Board Member elections. Inactive Individual Member accounts are 
    transitioned to Community account level automatically after a period of inactivity. 
    You may also log into your profile at any time and adjust your membership level.

  text: >
    With a Community account, you still have the opportunity to participate in many of 
    the OpenInfra Foundation's community activities, such as submitting and voting on 
    proposed summit talks. However, to run for leadership positions and vote in elections, 
    you will need to upgrade your account to an Individual Member account (please see 
    above). Get an OpenStackID to participate in Community Events, without a 
    Foundation Membership.
