        Projects that call OpenInfra Foundation their home each value open
        collaboration and exemplify the Four Opens (open source, design,
        development, community). All of our projects have a strategic focus,
        vision & scope that furthers the OpenInfra Foundation mission of
        supporting the development and adoption of production infrastructure
        with open source components.

        We value project individuality and collaboration. The quality of each
        project is our main focus, not the overall quantity of projects we host.
        Our model provides the support system and collaborative environment
        where communities are able to focus their attention on the important
        work of building and operating software that solves real problems around
        the globe.
