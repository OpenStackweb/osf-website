      scaling out to hundreds of thousands of commodity nodes. But there is
      another dimension to Large Scale OpenStack: using OpenStack to build
      supercomputers to use in research and HPC. In this episode, operators of
      OpenStack supercomputers and HPC centers will discuss the unique
      challenges this use case brings."

  - episodeDescription: For the uninitiated, OpenStack's role in programmable
      infrastructure can be a little hard to understand unless you know its
      capabilities and how it works. Furthermore, to some people, OpenStack
      looks very similar to virtualization or simply like existing public cloud
      offerings. To fully understand this cloud platform, we will start at the
      origins of cloud technology and end at how today's OpenStack works.

    episodeDescription: One of the reasons workloads moved to virtualization and
      clouds was to avoid having underutilized resources. But as demand for
      resources goes up and down, the cloud itself can now have a lot of spare
      capacity. How do OpenStack-based large scale clouds manage their spare
      capacity? Join this live discussion between operators of private and
      public clouds with InMotion Hosting, CERN, NECTAR research cloud, Verizon
      Media, City Network and Open Telekom Cloud.
