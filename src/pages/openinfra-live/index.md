    episodeDescription: >
      AI agents introduce a fundamentally different risk profile than
      traditional microservices or batch workloads. With access to models,
      memory, tools, external APIs, and sometimes direct execution capabilities,
      agents can observe, reason, and act in ways that expand the attack surface
      far beyond standard containerized applications. The question is no longer
      just how to scale AI, but how to securely contain it.


      In this live discussion with leaders from Ant Group, NVIDIA, Google, and the Linux Foundation, we’ll explore why traditional container isolation may be insufficient for agent-based systems, and what changes when agents have memory persistence, filesystem access, GPU acceleration, or external execution authority. We’ll examine how approaches like Kata-based agent sandboxes provide lightweight VM isolation to restrict runtime behavior, minimize host visibility, and reduce cross-session risk, including emerging concerns like GPU memory leakage.


      From runtime guardrails and privilege boundaries to telemetry capture and performance trade-offs, this session will unpack what “secure-by-design” means for AI agents. Finally, we’ll look ahead: will agent virtualization become a standard layer of AI infrastructure, and are sandboxes destined to become a universal requirement for production AI platforms?

      Organizations have turned to the cloud to increase operational efficiency
      while decreasing costs. Recent studies have shown that these same
      organizations are turning to hybrid cloud infrastructure powered by a
      mixture of open source technologies for additional flexibility around
      workload repatriation. 


      Within production hybrid clouds, OpenInfra technologies provide container security, edge nodes, CI/CD, secure private clouds and the largest footprint of public cloud data centers in the world. Tune into this episode and learn about what private & hybrid cloud sessions will be featured at the OpenInfra Summit Berlin, Germany on June 7-9, 2022!

    episodeDescription: "When we talk about Large Scale, it usually refers to
      scaling out to hundreds of thousands of commodity nodes. But there is
      another dimension to Large Scale OpenStack: using OpenStack to build
      supercomputers to use in research and HPC. In this episode, operators of
      OpenStack supercomputers and HPC centers will discuss the unique
      challenges this use case brings."

  - episodeDescription: For the uninitiated, OpenStack's role in programmable
      infrastructure can be a little hard to understand unless you know its
      capabilities and how it works. Furthermore, to some people, OpenStack
      looks very similar to virtualization or simply like existing public cloud
      offerings. To fully understand this cloud platform, we will start at the
      origins of cloud technology and end at how today's OpenStack works.

    episodeDescription: One of the reasons workloads moved to virtualization and
      clouds was to avoid having underutilized resources. But as demand for
      resources goes up and down, the cloud itself can now have a lot of spare
      capacity. How do OpenStack-based large scale clouds manage their spare
      capacity? Join this live discussion between operators of private and
      public clouds with InMotion Hosting, CERN, NECTAR research cloud, Verizon
