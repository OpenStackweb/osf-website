This page will be updated regularly with information on our onsite health and safety protocols for the OpenInfra Summit. Our attendeesâ€™ health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19 and look to venue, local, and WHO guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.

#### Onsite Safety Precautions

Here are the current health and safety plans for onsite at the Summit:

- Mandatory indoor mask mandate for all attendees except while eating and drinking in designated areas or when delivering a conference talk. Indoor eating will be socially distanced and outdoor eating options will be available.
- Vaccinations will be required. Anything approved by the WHO will be accepted, and a minimum of two shots is required. Proof of vaccination will be required at badge pickup.
- Signage throughout the event indicating required health and safety protocols and encouraging hand washing, social distancing, etc.
- Outdoor areas for mask breaks and eating/drinking
- Indoor eating/drinking areas with individual seating in socially distanced areas
- Reduced conference room capacities with distanced seating
- More physical space in conference rooms between speaker and attendees to allow speakers to give their talks without wearing masks, while keeping attendees at a safe distance
- Booth staff are required to wear masks while at the booth. Event participants are required to wear a mask when visiting booths and are encouraged to not crowd around booths. OpenInfra Marketplace booths will be open Tuesday - Thursday and exact timing will be published soon.
- Onsite cleaning and sanitizing of all touch points, including badge pickup and breakout session rooms
- Plentiful sanitation stations onsite with alcohol-based hand sanitizer
