Our attendeesâ€™ health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19. We will follow all venue, local, and WHO guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements. 

**This list, and all protocols, are subject to change as the COVID-19 guidelines evolve.**

Here are the current health and safety plans for onsite at the Summit:

- Mandatory indoor mask mandate for all attendees except while eating and drinking in designated areas or when delivering a conference talk. Indoor eating will be socially distanced and outdoor eating options will be available.
- On-site attendees will be required to be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks (14 full days) after the final dose of a [WHO-approved vaccine](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/). Proof of full vaccination will be required at badge pickup.
- Signage throughout the event indicating required health and safety protocols and encouraging hand washing, social distancing, etc.
- Outdoor areas will be available for mask breaks and eating/drinking.
- More physical space in conference rooms between speaker and attendees to allow speakers to give their talks without wearing masks, while keeping attendees at a safe distance.
- Booth staff are required to wear masks while at the booth. Event participants are required to wear a mask when visiting booths and are encouraged to not crowd around booths.
- Onsite cleaning and sanitizing of all touch points, including badge pickup and breakout session rooms.
- Sanitation stations will be available throughout  the site with alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
