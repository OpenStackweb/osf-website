  text1: "At OpenInfra Foundation we value project individuality and
    collaboration. The quality of each project is our main focus, not the
    overall  quantity of projects we host. There is no template or a
    one-size-fits-all model for the way we engage and support open  source
    projects. Each project is unique and each community has specific needs. We
    welcome every project with personalized  support and attention to detail.
    Our team is genuinely welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable and passionate about
    helping  communities grow and thrive. We do not sit on the sidelines; we
    actively participate in each and every community that we serve        "
  text2: Our model provides the support system and collaborative environment where
    communities are able to focus their attention  on the important work of
    building and operating software that solves real problems around the globe.
