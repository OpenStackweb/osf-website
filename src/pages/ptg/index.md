  description: >-
    The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) allows OpenInfra community groups and adjacent open source community project teams to meet virtually, exchange ideas and get work done in a productive, low-key setting. The ‘co-location’ of these meetings into a combined event, in conjunction with the dynamic scheduling and transparency of topics being discussed, enables open collaboration for communities to discuss any specific topic.

### How can this benefit my organization?

Our community is global. This creates challenges that cannot easily be solved using asynchronous, low-bandwidth communication tools. Getting technical community members to meet regularly is essential to build the amount of shared understandings and trust that is necessary to successfully cooperate. Participants to the event are therefore a lot more productive and efficient the rest of the year.

PTGs are organized in a virtual setting, or in cost-effective transportation hubs in order to minimize travel expense. At the same time, we aim to maximize the ability of contributors to work through their workgroup objectives in an environment that is focused towards work and productivity.

### Code of Conduct

All attendees of the Project Teams Gathering must follow the OpenInfra Foundation community [Code of Conduct](/legal/code-of-conduct).
