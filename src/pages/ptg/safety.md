Our attendees’ health and safety remain our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19. We will follow all venue, local, and CDC guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.

**This list, and all protocols, are subject to change as the COVID-19 guidelines evolve.**

Here are the current health and safety plans for onsite at the PTG:

- Mandatory indoor masks (over nose and mouth) for all attendees except while eating and drinking in designated areas.
- On-site attendees will be required to be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks (14 full days) after the final dose of a [CDC-approved vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html#covid-vaccines).
- Proof of full vaccination will be required at badge pickup.
- An outdoor area will be available for mask breaks and eating/drinking.
- Hand sanitation stations will be available throughout the venue with alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
