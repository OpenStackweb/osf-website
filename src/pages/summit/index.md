    WHAT IS A <span class="red">COMMUNITY POWERED OPENINFRA SUMMIT</span>?
  text: |
    <p>
      The <b>OpenInfra community</b>, a global collaboration of <b>110,000 people across 187 countries</b>, builds and operates
      infrastructure powered by open source software.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past decade, the <b>OpenInfra Summit</b> has provided a
      centralized opportunity for the global community to collaborate. <b>To build the next decade of open
      infrastructure, OpenInfra Summits will be developed by the community</b> for the community. Community volunteers
      will provide an opportunity to collaborate directly with the people building and running open source
      infrastructure using Linux, OpenStack, Kubernetes and 30+ other technologies. Attendees typically represent
      60 countries and hundreds of organizations and participate in keynote presentations from industry leaders,
      breakout presentations, Forum discussions with operators and developers, and a busy hallway track of open
      source enthusiasts.
