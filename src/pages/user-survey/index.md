  title: About the User Survey
  description: |-
    User surveys are a critical tool in closing the feedback loop between OpenInfra 
    operators and the upstream contributors who are building the software. By sharing 
    technical implementations, feature requests and software challenges, operators 
    are directly impacting the development and roadmap of the open source software. 
    Each project has its own project user survey, so if youâ€™re evaluating, testing, 
    or running an OpenInfra project in production, please participate by completing 
    a user survey. With your help, we can build open source communities who run 
    software that runs in production.
