The Zuul User Survey began collecting responses in March 2020 and has received almost 30 organization submissions to date.

Of these organizations, a whopping 69% are running Zuul in production, 17% are evaluating Zuul, and 14% are considering using Zuul.

The amount of jobs run per day varies by organization. 69% of organizations run less than 100 jobs per day, 12% run 100-1,000 jobs per day, 8% run 1,000-10,000 jobs per day, 8% run 10,000 - 100,000 jobs per day and 4% run more than 100,000 jobs per day.

Organizations who completed the Zuul User Survey include BMW, Volvo, NTT, Wazo-Platform, Good Money, leboncoin, T-Systems, 99Cloud, CESNET, OpenDev, Red Hat and Just Eat. Additional organizations have requested to remain anonymous.

**When asked, what they like most about Zuul, besides “free” and “open,” respondents said:**

- Solve a lot of the pain points I have with Jenkins. Job dependencies management; the advanced capabilities of executor; multi-node testing concept; integration of ansible; out of the box support of various drivers that save me from looking for plugins of varying level of quality. The community on IRC has been great.
- Gating - Cross Project Dependencies
- The improved iteration cycle that Zuul gives teams when testing changes. The ability to interact with zuul using github comments to trigger actions. The irc channel that is very helpful when I have queries and has super fast and friendly responses.

**The NPS score of the Zuul project is 59. Some of the reasons provided included:**

- (8) The bottom-up approach. Needs some effort to get started but it feels like you can build your toolchain from scratch with just the necessary parts.
- (8) Scalability at its core. - Bridging the multi-repo gap intelligently.
- (9) Easy to use - we copy over everything from the open source/upstream repos as our stuff plugs into it, so it was a no-brainer. - Easy to define what needs to be tested, easy to understand, easy to add jobs or different
- (10) Speculative merge in our gate have saved us many times...An aspect that makes us willing to share expensive licenses, like those of embedded compilers, is the ability to set priority between check, gate and custom jobs. So when all nodes are busy, the most important jobs are run first and deadlines are secured. Infrastructure as code is a game changer, and something we appreciated when going from Zuul v2.6 to 3.18. As our software development teams deploy on more embedded targets we get dependencies between different projects. Here we have started to enjoy the ability to set cross project dependencies.

- (10) Zuul's gating functionality allows our users to land code knowing that it works. This makes releasing software on time simple and easy. Additionally Zuul's ability to test many pieces of software from different locations allows us to run complex test jobs that simulate real world deployments.
- (10) The improved iteration cycle that Zuul gives teams when testing changes. The ability to interact with zuul using github comments to trigger actions. The IRC channel is very helpful when I have queries and has super fast and friendly responses.
