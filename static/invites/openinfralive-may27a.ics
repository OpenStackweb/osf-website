In this OpenInfra Live episode\, Jim Blair\, Zuul Maintainer and CEO at Acme Gating\, and Mohammed Naser\, CEO of Vexxhost will provide an overview of Zuul\, the open source CI/CD business case and a demo showing what cross project dependencies look like in production.\n\nWatch live at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MptrjDKrKhI
